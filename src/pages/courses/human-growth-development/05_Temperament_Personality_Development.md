# Temperament and Personality Development

## Introduction

From the moment of birth, infants display distinctive individual differences in how they respond to the world. Some babies are calm and easy to soothe, while others are fussy and difficult to comfort. Some are bold and adventurous, while others are cautious and hesitant. These early-appearing individual differences in mood, activity level, and emotional reactivity form the foundation of temperament. As children grow, temperament interacts with experience to create personality—the characteristic pattern of thinking, feeling, and behaving that makes each person unique. This comprehensive guide explores temperament and personality development from infancy through adulthood.

## 1. Defining Temperament

### What Is Temperament?

**Temperament** refers to innate characteristics of the infant, including mood, activity level, and emotional reactivity, noticeable soon after birth.

**Key Characteristics of Temperament:**
- **Biologically based**: Has genetic/constitutional origins
- **Appears early**: Evident in infancy
- **Relatively stable**: Shows consistency across situations and time
- **Influences behavior**: Affects how child interacts with environment
- **Foundation for personality**: Provides biological base for personality development

### Temperament vs. Personality

**Temperament:**
- Present from birth
- Biologically based
- Relatively stable emotional and behavioral tendencies
- Foundation

**Personality:**
- Develops over time
- Result of temperament + experience
- Characteristic manner of thinking, feeling, behaving, and relating to others
- More complex and multifaceted than temperament
- Includes values, goals, motivations, self-concept, coping styles

## 2. Classic Temperament Research: Chess and Thomas

### The New York Longitudinal Study (1956)

Chess and Thomas conducted landmark research evaluating 141 children's temperament based on parental interviews.

### Nine Dimensions of Temperament

Children were assessed on nine dimensions:

1. **Activity Level**: How much the child moves during daily activities
2. **Rhythmicity**: Regularity of biological functions (sleep, hunger, elimination)
3. **Approach/Withdrawal**: How child responds to new situations, people, objects
4. **Adaptability**: How easily child adjusts to changes
5. **Intensity of Reaction**: Energy level of responses (loud vs. quiet, vigorous vs. mild)
6. **Threshold of Responsiveness**: How intense a stimulus must be for child to react
7. **Quality of Mood**: Overall mood (pleasant/friendly vs. unpleasant/unfriendly)
8. **Distractibility**: How easily external stimuli interfere with ongoing behavior
9. **Attention Span and Persistence**: How long child pursues activity, continues despite obstacles

### Three Temperament Categories

Based on profiles across the nine dimensions:

**Easy Child (40%)**
- Quickly adapts to routine and new situations
- Remains calm
- Easy to soothe
- Usually in positive mood
- Regular biological rhythms
- Approaches new experiences positively

**Difficult Child (10%)**
- Reacts negatively to new situations
- Trouble adapting to routines
- Irregular biological rhythms
- Usually negative in mood
- Intense reactions
- Cries frequently
- Slow to adapt to change

**Slow-to-Warm-Up Child (15%)**
- Low activity level
- Adjusts slowly to new situations
- Initially withdraws from new experiences
- Often negative in mood
- Mild intensity of reactions
- Eventually adapts with repeated exposure

**Note**: 35% of children did not fit neatly into one category (showed mixed patterns).

### Implications for Caregiving

**Easy Child:**
- Requires minimal extra attention
- Naturally adaptable

**Difficult Child:**
- Needs extra time to burn energy
- Benefits from patience
- Requires consistent routines
- May need warning before transitions

**Slow-to-Warm-Up Child:**
- Needs advance warning of new situations
- Benefits from gradual introduction to novelty
- Requires patience during adjustment period

## 3. Goodness of Fit

### Definition

**Goodness of fit** occurs when a caregiver's parenting style matches and accommodates the child's temperament.

### Achieving Good Fit

**Parental Strategies:**
- Recognize child's temperament
- Accept temperamental characteristics
- Adjust expectations to child's capabilities
- Adapt parenting strategies to child's needs
- Provide appropriate environmental support

**Examples:**
- **Adventurous child + outdoorsy parents**: Taking child on hikes provides good fit
- **Shy child + patient parents**: Allowing gradual warm-up to new situations
- **Active child + active family**: Providing physical outlets matches temperament

### Poor Fit Consequences

When temperament and environment mismatch:
- Increased parent-child conflict
- Parental stress and frustration
- Child behavior problems
- Reduced parental confidence
- Negative parent-child relationship

## 4. Bidirectional Parenting

### Child Effects on Parents

Not only do parents affect children—children influence parents through their temperamental characteristics.

**Easy Temperament Effects:**
- Parents feel more effective
- Easily soothe child
- Elicit smiling, cooing
- More positive interactions
- Greater parenting satisfaction

**Difficult Temperament Effects:**
- Parents feel less effective
- Difficulty soothing child
- Fewer positive reactions elicited
- Over time, parents may become:
  - More punitive
  - Less patient
  - More frustrated

**Broader Impacts:**
- Parents with fussy, difficult child report less marital satisfaction
- Greater challenges balancing work and family roles
- More parenting stress

### Reciprocal Influence

**Dynamic Process:**
- Child's temperament affects parenting
- Parenting affects child's behavior
- Child's behavior reinforces or changes parenting
- Ongoing circular influence

## 5. Temperament Stability Across Development

### Does Temperament Change?

Research shows both **stability** and **change**:

**Evidence for Stability:**
- Temperamental characteristics show consistency from infancy through adulthood
- Inhibited infants tend to become shy children and anxious adults
- Easy babies tend to become well-adjusted adults
- Difficult babies show more adjustment problems later

**Evidence for Change:**
- Environment can modify temperamental expression
- People learn to work around temperamental qualities
- Life experiences shape how temperament manifests
- Maturation affects temperamental expression

### Kagan's Research on Inhibition

**Jerome Kagan** studied temperamental inhibition to the unfamiliar:

**Highly Reactive Infants:**
- React strongly to unfamiliarity
- Cry loudly
- Pump limbs
- Increased heart rate
- Show temperamental stability into early childhood

**Amygdala Studies:**
- Young adults previously identified as inhibited toddlers showed heightened amygdala activation
- Demonstrates biological basis of temperament
- Brain differences persist into adulthood

**Adult Outcomes:**
- Shyness in infancy linked to social anxiety in adulthood
- Not deterministic—environment matters
- Many inhibited children don't develop anxiety disorders

### Factors Affecting Stability

**Genetics:**
- Provide biological foundation
- Major reason for stability

**Environment:**
- Can strengthen or weaken temperamental tendencies
- Mainly responsible for change
- Supportive vs. abusive parenting
- Socioeconomic factors
- Life experiences
- Cultural context

**Gene-Environment Interactions:**
- Genes affected by environmental factors (epigenetics)
- Environment can modify gene expression
- Stress, nutrition, toxins can switch genes on/off

**Niche-Picking:**
- Individuals seek environments supporting their temperament
- Further strengthens temperamental tendencies
- Example: Musically inclined children seek music instruction

## 6. From Temperament to Personality

### Personality Development

**Personality** is the result of continuous interplay between biological disposition (temperament) and experience.

**Components Beyond Temperament:**
- Self-concept
- Motivations (achievement, social)
- Values and goals
- Coping styles
- Sense of responsibility and conscientiousness
- Moral development
- Identity

**Developmental Process:**
- Newborn has temperament, not personality
- As child matures, temperament elaborated through experience
- Close relationships guide growth of individual characteristics
- Personality becomes increasingly nuanced and complex

**Example:**
- Newborn who cries frequently ≠ "grumpy personality"
- With parental support and security, may become less fussy
- Develops into adult with depth and nuance

## 10. Adult Attachment Styles

### Attachment and Temperament

Early temperament influences attachment patterns, which continue into adulthood.

### Hazan and Shaver's Adult Attachment Styles

Three categories based on Ainsworth's infant attachment:

**Secure:**
"I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable depending on them and having them depend on me. I don't often worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me."

**Avoidant:**
"I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when anyone gets too close, and often, love partners want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being."

**Anxious/Ambivalent:**
"I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesn't really love me or won't stay with me. I want to merge completely with another person, and this sometimes scares people away."

### Bartholomew's Two-Dimensional Model

**Two Dimensions:**

1. **Attachment-related anxiety**: Worry about whether partner really loves them; fear of rejection/abandonment

2. **Attachment-related avoidance**: Discomfort with opening up and depending on others; fear of lost autonomy

**Four Attachment Styles:**

**Secure:**
- Low anxiety, low avoidance
- Comfortable trusting partners
- Don't worry excessively about partner's love

**Dismissing:**
- Low anxiety, high avoidance
- Dismiss importance of relationships
- Trust self but not others
- Don't share dreams, goals, fears

**Preoccupied:**
- High anxiety, low avoidance
- Prone to jealousy
- Worry partner doesn't love them enough

**Fearful-Avoidant:**
- High anxiety, high avoidance
- Want close relationships
- Don't feel comfortable getting emotionally close
- Trust issues with self and others

### Adult Attachment Research Findings

**Relationship Satisfaction:**
- Insecure attachments → lower satisfaction
- High anxiety → more daily conflict
- Avoidant attachment → less partner support

**Age Differences:**
- Young adults show greater attachment anxiety than middle-aged or older adults
- Some studies: young adults show more avoidance
- Other studies: middle-aged adults show higher avoidance

**Parental Relationships:**
- Secure attachments with parents → easier transition to adulthood
- Authoritative parents + secure attachment → less depression
- Insecure attachments + authoritarian/permissive parents → more depression

## 11. Cultural Influences on Temperament and Personality

### Cultural Values

Different cultures emphasize different temperamental qualities:

**Collectivist Cultures:**
- Value harmony, cooperation
- Quiet, reserved temperament seen positively
- Self-control emphasized
- Group needs over individual expression

**Individualist Cultures:**
- Value independence, assertiveness
- Outgoing, expressive temperament valued
- Individual achievement emphasized
- Personal expression encouraged

### Cultural Shaping

Culture influences:
- Which temperamental traits are encouraged
- How personality develops
- What personality characteristics are valued
- How traits are expressed
- Meaning of behaviors

## 12. Temperament and Psychopathology

### Risk and Resilience

Temperament can create vulnerability or protection:

**Risk Factors:**
- High negative emotionality → anxiety, depression
- Low effortful control → behavior problems
- High reactivity → stress-related disorders

**Protective Factors:**
- Positive emotionality → resilience
- Good self-regulation → better outcomes
- Adaptive temperament → buffer against stress

### Not Deterministic

**Important Points:**
- Temperament ≠ destiny
- Environment crucially important
- Many pathways from temperament to outcomes
- Intervention can modify risk
- Goodness of fit matters

## Conclusion

Temperament and personality development represent the fascinating interplay between biology and experience. From the earliest temperamental characteristics evident in newborns through the complex, nuanced personalities of adults, this developmental process demonstrates that while we are born with certain predispositions, our experiences profoundly shape who we become.

Understanding temperament and personality development helps us:
- Recognize and appreciate individual differences
- Adjust caregiving to match children's needs
- Understand continuity and change across the lifespan
- Appreciate that "difficult" temperament doesn't mean bad or unchangeable
- Recognize the importance of goodness of fit
- Understand our own personality patterns and their origins
- Make informed decisions about environments and relationships

The recognition that temperament provides a foundation but doesn't determine destiny offers hope—with appropriate support, understanding, and environmental fit, individuals of all temperamental types can thrive and develop healthy, adaptive personalities.
