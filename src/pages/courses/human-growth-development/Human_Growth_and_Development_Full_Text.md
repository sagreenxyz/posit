# Human Growth and Development - Full Course Text

### Section 1: Introduction

This section addresses the period of life from its earliest moment—conception—through early childhood. Three aspects that define all humans are covered for this period of life: physical development, cognitive development, and psychosocial development. This section covers two competencies in twelve lessons:

- Lesson 1: Genetic Influences during Prenatal Development
- Lesson 2: Physical Growth and the Newborn
- Lesson 3: Physical Growth in Early Childhood
- Lesson 4: Genetic Influences on Cognitive Development
- Lesson 5: Cognitive Development and the Newborn
- Lesson 6: Cognitive Development in Early Childhood
- Lesson 7: Psychosocial Development and the Newborn
- Lesson 8: Psychosocial Development during Toddlerhood
- Lesson 9: Emotions and Psychosocial Development through Early Childhood
- Lesson 10: Emotions and Behavior through Early Childhood
- Lesson 11: Cultural Influences and the Newborn
- Lesson 12: Cultural Influences in Early Childhood

### Build Employability Skills and Competence

The skills addressed in this section are valuable for all adults, and particularly so for anyone in or aspiring to a career in the health professions. These skills are: 

1. Identify expected growth and changes at all physical, cognitive, and psychosocial stages of development. 
2. Demonstrate an understanding of different cultures and perspectives.
3. Describe the impact emotional states have on one's physiological state, behavior, and attitudes.

In this section, you can demonstrate these skills by passing a final assessment that measures whether you have mastered the following competencies:

- Explain physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development from conception through early childhood.
- Explain the influence of emotions and cultural perspectives and practices on psychosocial development and behavior from birth through early childhood.

### Prepare for the Assessment

To prepare for the competency objective assessment, ask yourself these questions:

- Can I identify the milestones in physical development from conception through early childhood?
- Can I identify the milestones in cognitive development from conception through early childhood?
- Can I identify the milestones in psychosocial development from conception through early childhood?
- Can I describe how emotions influence psychosocial development and behavior from birth through early childhood?
- Can I describe how cultural perspectives and practices influence psychosocial development and behavior from birth through early childhood?

### Move Ahead if Ready

Are you ready to demonstrate your competency and skills? 

If you answered yes to all the "Prepare for the Assessment" questions, begin this section by taking the Section 1 assessment. If you do well and are confident, take the Pre-Assessment. Use your results, or results from a prior pre-assessment attempt, to help gauge your readiness to take the objective assessment. If you plan to move ahead, discuss your plan with your instructor.

### Lesson 1: Introduction

"Where do babies come from?" This common question forms the foundation for this lesson, which addresses genetic factors and typical development of an embryo and fetus.

In this lesson, you will follow the development of a human baby from its conception through its birth, learning a good deal about the experiences of its mother, as well, along the way.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Describe the significance of genetic influences on the physical growth and development of an embryo and fetus from conception through birth.

### Prenatal Development

Conception occurs and development begins. All of the major structures of the body are forming, and the health of the mother is of primary concern. Understanding nutrition, teratogens, or environmental factors that can lead to birth defects, and labor and delivery are primary concerns. You will focus on those issues later.

### Infancy and Toddlerhood 

The first two years of life are ones of dramatic growth and change. A newborn, with a keen sense of hearing but very poor vision, is transformed into a walking, talking toddler within a relatively short period of time. Caregivers are also transformed from someone who manages feeding and sleep schedules to a constantly moving guide and safety inspector for a mobile, energetic child. This set of photos shows typical development from infancy to toddlerhood.

### Conception and Fertilization

#### Implantation

The germinal period (about 14 days in length) lasts from conception to implantation of the fertilized egg in the lining of the uterus. At ejaculation millions of sperm are released into the vagina, but only a few reach the egg, and typically only one fertilizes the egg. Once a single sperm has entered the wall of the egg, the wall becomes hard and prevents other sperm from entering.  

#### Fertilization

After the sperm has entered the egg, the tail of the sperm breaks off and the head of the sperm, containing the genetic information from the father, unites with the nucleus of the egg. It is typically fertilized in the top section of the fallopian tube and continues its journey to the uterus. As a result, a new cell is formed. This cell, containing the combined genetic information from both parents, is referred to as a **zygote**. This image shows a sperm and ovum at conception.

### Mitosis

#### The Blastocyst

During this time, the organism begins cell division through mitosis. After five days of **mitosis,** there are 100 cells, which is now called a **blastocyst.** The blastocyst consists of both an inner and outer group of cells. The inner group of cells, or embryonic disk, will become the embryo, while the outer group of cells, or trophoblast, becomes the support system which nourishes the developing organism. 

This stage ends when the blastocyst fully implants into the uterine wall. Approximately 50 to 75 percent of blastocysts do not implant in the uterine wall.

#### High Failure Rate

Mitosis is a fragile process and fewer than half of all zygotes survive beyond the first two weeks. Some of the reasons for this include the egg and sperm do not join properly, thus their genetic material does not combine, there is too little or damaged genetic material, the zygote does not replicate, or the blastocyst does not implant into the uterine wall. The failure rate is higher for in vitro conceptions. 

This illustration shows the journey of the ova from its release to its fertilization, cell duplication, and implantation into the uterine lining.

### Implantation

By the third week after conception, the blastocyst has implanted in the uterine wall. Upon implantation this multicellular organism is called an **embryo.** Now blood vessels grow forming the placenta. The **placenta** is a structure connected to the uterus that provides nourishment and oxygen from the mother to the developing embryo via the umbilical cord. During this period, cells continue to differentiate. 

#### Processes of Growth

Growth during prenatal development occurs in two major directions: from head to tail (called **cephalocaudal development**) and from the midline outward (**proximodistal development**). This means that those structures nearest the head develop before those nearest the feet and those structures nearest the torso develop before those away from the center of the body (such as hands and fingers). The head develops in the fourth week and the precursor to the heart begins to pulse. In the early stages of the embryonic period, gills and a tail are apparent. However, by the end of this stage, the gills and tail disappear, and the organism takes on a more human appearance.

### The Developing of the Embryo

#### Size of Embryo

The embryo is approximately one inch in length and weighs about eight grams (about the weight of a standard postcard) at the end of eight weeks. The embryo can move and respond to touch at this time.

#### Reasons for Failure

Some organisms fail during the embryonic period, usually due to gross chromosomal abnormalities. As in the case of the germinal period, often the mother does not yet know that she is pregnant. It is during this stage that the major structures of the body are taking form making the embryonic period the time when the organism is most vulnerable to the greatest amount of damage if exposed to harmful substances. Potential mothers are not often aware of the risks they introduce to the developing embryo during this time.

### Early and Middle Pregnancy

#### Early Pregnancy 

From the ninth week of pregnancy until birth, the developing organism is referred to as a **fetus.** During this stage, the major structures are continuing to develop. By the third month, the fetus has all its body parts including external genitalia. In the following weeks, the fetus will develop hair, nails, and teeth, and the excretory and digestive systems will continue to develop. The fetus is about three inches long and weighs about 28 grams.

#### Middle Pregnancy

During the fourth through sixth months of pregnancy, the fetus's eyes become more sensitive to light and hearing develops. The respiratory system continues to develop, and reflexes such as sucking, swallowing, and hiccupping develop during the fifth month. Cycles of sleep and wakefulness are present at this time as well. 

#### Viability

The first chance of survival outside the womb, known as the age of **viability**, is reached at about 24 weeks. Many practitioners hesitate to resuscitate before 24 weeks. The majority of the neurons in the brain have developed by 24 weeks, although they are still rudimentary, and the glial (nurse) cells that support neurons continue to grow. At 24 weeks, the fetus can feel pain.

### Later Pregnancy

#### Seventh and Eighth Months of Pregnancy

Between the seventh and ninth months, the fetus is preparing for birth. It is exercising its muscles and its lungs begin to expand and contract. The fetus gains about five pounds in weight and about seven inches in length during this last trimester of pregnancy, and during the eighth month, a layer of fat develops under the skin. This layer of fat serves as insulation and helps the baby regulate body temperature after birth.

#### Ninth Month of Pregnancy

At around 36 weeks, the fetus is almost ready for birth. It weighs about six pounds and is about 18.5 inches long. By week 37, all of the fetus’s organ systems are developed enough that it could survive outside the mother’s uterus without many of the risks associated with premature birth. The fetus continues to gain weight and grow in length until approximately 40 weeks. By then the fetus has very little room to move around and birth becomes imminent. 

The progression through the stages is shown in this illustration.

- **fetus:** unborn mammalian offspring; in humans, from week nine through birth
- **viability:** able to live independently outside a mother's uterus

### Mothers over 35

#### Increased Risks

Most women over 35 who become pregnant are in good health and have healthy pregnancies. However, women over age 35 are more likely to have an increased risk of:

- Fertility problems
- High blood pressure
- Diabetes
- Miscarriages
- Placenta previa
- Cesarean section
- Premature birth
- Stillbirth
- A baby with a genetic disorder or other birth defects

#### Teratogens 

Because a woman is born with all her eggs, environmental **teratogens**—that is, anything that interferes with normal fetal development—can affect the quality of the eggs as women get older. Also, a woman’s reproductive system ages, which can adversely affect the pregnancy. Some women over 35 choose special prenatal screening tests, such as a maternal blood screening, to determine if there are any health risks for the baby.

#### Benefits of Delaying Pregnancy

Although there are medical concerns associated with having a child later in life, there are also many positive consequences to being a more mature parent. Older parents are more confident, less stressed, and typically married, providing family stability. Their children perform better on math and reading tests, and they are less prone to injuries or emotional troubles. Women who choose to wait are often well educated and lead healthy lives.

Older women are more stable, demonstrate a stronger family focus, possess greater self-confidence, and have more money. Having a child later in one’s career equals overall higher wages. In fact, for every year a woman delays motherhood, she makes 9 percent more in lifetime earnings. Lastly, women who delay having children actually live longer. Women who have their last child after the age of 33 double their chances of living to age 95 or older, compared with women who had their last child before age 30. A woman’s natural ability to have a child at a later age indicates that her reproductive system is aging slowly, and consequently, so is the rest of her body. 

### Teenage Pregnancy

#### Risks for Mother and Baby

A teenage mother is at a greater risk for having pregnancy complications, including anemia and high blood pressure. These risks are even greater for those under age 15. 

Infants born to teenage mothers have a higher risk of being premature and having low birth weight or other serious health problems. Premature and low birth weight babies may have organs that are not fully developed, which can result in breathing problems, bleeding in the brain, vision loss, and serious intestinal problems. Very low birth weight babies (less than 3.3 pounds) are over a hundred times more likely to die, and moderately low birth weight babies (between 3.3 and 5.5 pounds) are more than five times as likely to die in their first year, compared with babies of normal weight. Again, the risk is highest for babies of mothers under age 15. 

#### Reasons for Risks

Reasons for these health issues include that teenagers are the least likely of all age groups to get early and regular prenatal care. Additionally, they may engage in negative behaviors including eating unhealthy food, smoking, drinking alcohol, and taking drugs. Additional concerns for teenagers are repeat births. About 25 percent of teen mothers under age 18 have a second baby within two years after the first baby’s birth.

### Gestational Diabetes

#### Definitions

Seven percent of pregnant women develop gestational diabetes. Diabetes is a condition where the body has too much glucose (a form of sugar) in the bloodstream. Most pregnant women have their glucose levels tested at 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after the mother gives birth, but it might indicate a risk for developing diabetes later in life. 

#### Risks for the Baby

If untreated, gestational diabetes can cause premature birth, stillbirth, or the baby having breathing problems at birth, jaundice, or low blood sugar. Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes can also be considerably heavier (more than nine pounds), making the labor and birth process more difficult. 

#### Risks for the Mother

For expectant mothers, untreated gestational diabetes can cause **preeclampsia** (high blood pressure and signs that the liver and kidneys may not be working properly). Risk factors for gestational diabetes include age (being over age 25), being overweight or gaining too much weight during pregnancy, a family history of diabetes, having had gestational diabetes with a prior pregnancy, and race and ethnicity (African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and Pacific Islanders have a higher risk). 

Eating well and maintaining a healthy weight during pregnancy can reduce the chance of gestational diabetes. Women who already have diabetes and become pregnant need to attend all their prenatal care visits and follow medical advice, since they face the same risks of preeclampsia, premature birth, birth defects, and stillbirth as women with gestational diabetes. 

### High Blood Pressure and Rh Disease

#### High Blood Pressure

High blood pressure (also called hypertension) is a condition in which the pressure against the wall of the arteries becomes too high. There are two types of high blood pressure during pregnancy: gestational and chronic. 

**Gestational hypertension** only occurs during pregnancy and goes away after birth. Chronic high blood pressure refers to women who already had hypertension before the pregnancy, or to those who developed it during pregnancy, and it continued after birth. About eight of every hundred pregnant women have high blood pressure. High blood pressure during pregnancy can cause premature birth, low birth weight (under five and a half pounds), and placental abruption; mothers can also develop preeclampsia. 

#### Rh Disease 

Rh is a protein found in the blood. Most people are Rh-positive, meaning that they have this protein. Some people, however, are Rh-negative, meaning this protein is absent. Mothers who are Rh-negative are at risk of having a baby with a form of anemia called **Rh disease**. 

A father who is Rh-positive and a mother who is Rh-negative can conceive a baby who is Rh-positive. Some of the fetus’s blood cells may get into the mother’s bloodstream; in such a case, her immune system is unable to recognize the Rh factor. The immune system starts to produce antibodies to fight off what it thinks is a foreign invader. 

Once her body produces immunity, the antibodies can cross the placenta and start to destroy the red blood cells of the developing fetus. This process takes time, so often the first Rh-positive baby is not harmed, but as the mother’s body will continue to produce antibodies to the Rh factor throughout her lifetime, subsequent pregnancies can pose a greater risk for an Rh-positive baby. In the newborn, Rh disease can lead to jaundice, anemia, heart failure, brain damage, and death.

### Weight Gain during Pregnancy

#### Calorie Requirements

During pregnancy, most women need only an additional 300 calories per day to aid in the growth of the fetus. Gaining too little or too much weight during pregnancy can be harmful. Women who gain too little may have a baby who is low-birth weight, while those who gain too much are likely to have a premature or large baby. 

There is also a greater risk for the mother developing preeclampsia and diabetes, which can cause further problems during the pregnancy. Putting on the weight slowly is best. Mothers who are concerned about their weight gain should talk to their health care provider.

#### Healthy Weight Gain

This table shows healthy weight gain during pregnancy. Note that mothers of twins (and other multiples) need to gain more weight in each of these categories.

#### Table S1 L1.6 Healthy Weight Gain During Pregnancy
A woman at a healthy weight before pregnancy should:An underweight woman before pregnancy should:An overweight woman before pregnancy should:An obese woman before pregnancy should:
- 
gain 25 to 35 pounds total

- 
gain 1 to 4.5 pounds during the first trimester and 1 pound per week during the second and third trimesters

- 
gain 28 to 40 pounds total

- 
gain 1 to 4.5 pounds during the first trimester and little more than 1 pound per week during the second and third trimesters

- 
gain 12 to 25 pounds total

- 
gain 1 to 4.5 pounds during the first trimester and a little more than half a pound per week during the second and third trimesters

- 
gain 11 to 20 pounds total

- 
gain 1 to 4.5 pounds during the first trimester and less than half a pound per week during the second and third trimesters

### Stress and Depression

#### Stress

Feeling stressed is common during pregnancy, but high levels of stress can cause complications; these include having a premature baby or a low-birth-weight baby. Babies born early or too small are at an increased risk for health problems. Stress-related hormones may cause these complications by affecting a woman’s immune systems resulting in an infection and premature birth. Additionally, some women deal with stress by smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking drugs, which can lead to problems in the pregnancy. 

High levels of stress in pregnancy have also been correlated with problems in the baby’s brain development and immune system functioning, as well as childhood problems such as trouble paying attention and being afraid. 

#### Depression 

Depression is a significant medical condition in which feelings of sadness, worthlessness, guilt, and fatigue interfere with one’s daily functioning. Depression can occur before, during, or after pregnancy. One woman out of seven is treated for depression sometime between the year before pregnancy and the year after pregnancy. 

Women who have experienced depression previously are more likely to have depression during pregnancy. Consequences of depression include the baby being born prematurely, having a low birth weight, being more irritable, less active, less attentive, and having fewer facial expressions. 

About 13 percent of pregnant women take an antidepressant during pregnancy. It is important that women taking antidepressants during pregnancy discuss the medication with a healthcare provider as some medications can cause harm to the developing organism. In fact, birth defects happen about two or three times more often in women who are prescribed certain **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)** for their depression.

### Complications of Pregnancy

#### Minor Complications 

There are a number of common side effects of pregnancy. Not everyone experiences all of these, nor to the same degree. Although they are considered minor, it would be wrong to say that these problems are not potentially very uncomfortable. These side effects include nausea (particularly during the first three or four months of pregnancy as a result of higher levels of estrogen in the system), heartburn, gas, hemorrhoids, backache, leg cramps, insomnia, constipation, shortness of breath, and varicose veins (as a result of carrying a heavy load on the abdomen).

#### Major Complications

The following are some serious complications of pregnancy that can pose health risks to mother and child and which often require hospitalization.

**Ectopic (tubal) pregnancy** occurs when the zygote becomes attached to the fallopian tube before reaching the uterus. About one in fifty pregnancies in the United States are ectopic pregnancies and this number has been increasing because of the higher rates of pelvic inflammatory disease and chlamydia (a sexually transmitted disease caused by a parasitic bacterium). Abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, nausea, and fainting are symptoms of ectopic implantation.

Preeclampsia, also known as toxemia, is characterized by a sharp rise in blood pressure, a leakage of protein into the urine as a result of kidney problems, and swelling of the hands, feet, and face during the third trimester of pregnancy. When preeclampsia causes seizures, the condition is known as **eclampsia,** which is the second leading cause of maternal death in the United States.

Preeclampsia is the most common complication of pregnancy. It is estimated to affect 5 to 10 percent of all pregnancies globally and accounts for 40 to 60 percent of maternal deaths in developing countries. Rates are lower in the United States and preeclampsia affects about 3 to 5 percent of pregnant women. Preeclampsia occurs most frequently in first pregnancies, and it is more common in women who are obese, who have diabetes, or who are carrying twins. 

Preeclampsia is also a leading cause of fetal complications, which include low birth weight, premature birth, and stillbirth. Treatment is typically bed rest and sometimes medication. If this treatment is ineffective, labor may be induced.

#### Maternal Mortality

About 700 American women die from complications related to pregnancy each year, and this number is rising. Further, 60 percent of those deaths could have been prevented. Bleeding, infections, and heart-related problems are the main causes. Possible contributing factors include the high cesarean section rate and obesity. Compared with rates in other developed nations, this number is considered high. 

Approximately a thousand women die in childbirth around the world each day. Rates are highest in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, although there has been a substantial decrease in these areas. The campaign to make childbirth safe for everyone has led to the development of clinics accessible to those living in more isolated areas and training more midwives to assist in childbirth.

**Spontaneous abortion** is experienced in an estimated 20 to 40 percent of undiagnosed pregnancies and in another 10 percent of diagnosed pregnancies. Usually, this occurs due to chromosomal abnormalities, typically before the twelfth week of pregnancy. Cramping and bleeding result and normal periods return after several months. Some women are more likely to have repeated miscarriages due to chromosomal, amniotic, or hormonal problems, but miscarriage can also be a result of defective sperm.

### Preparing for Childbirth

#### Parental Preparation

Prepared childbirth refers to being not only in good physical condition to help provide a healthy environment for the baby to develop but also helping individuals to prepare to accept their new roles as parents. Additionally, parents can receive information and training that will assist them for delivery and life with the baby. The more future parents can learn about childbirth and the newborn, the better prepared they will be for the adjustment they must make to a new life. 

One of the most common methods for preparing for childbirth is the **Lamaze Method.** This method originated in Russia and was brought to the United States in the 1950s by Fernand Lamaze. The emphasis of this method is on teaching the woman to be in control in the process of delivery. It includes learning muscle relaxation, breathing through contractions, having a focal point (usually a picture to look at) during contractions, and having a support person who goes through the training process with the mother and serves as a coach during delivery.

#### Choosing Delivery Location and Attendants

The vast majority of births in the United States occur in a hospital setting. However, one percent of women choose to deliver at home. Women who are at low risk for birth complications can successfully deliver at home. 

More than half (67 percent) of home deliveries are managed by certified nurse-midwives. Midwives are trained and licensed to assist in delivery and are far less expensive than the cost of a hospital delivery. However, because of the potential for a complication during the birth process, most medical professionals recommend that delivery take place in a hospital. Despite concerns, in the United States women who have had previous children, who are over 25, and who are white are more likely to have out-of-hospital births. In addition to home births, a third of non-hospital births occur in freestanding clinics, birthing centers, physician’s offices, or similar locations.

### Labor: The First Stage

#### Brief Contractions

The first stage of labor begins with uterine contractions that may initially last about 30 seconds, spaced 15 to 20 minutes apart. These increase in duration and frequency to more than a minute in length and about 3 to 4 minutes apart. Typically, doctors advise that they be called when contractions are coming about every five minutes. Some women experience false labor or **Braxton-Hicks contractions,** especially with the first child, which may come and go. They tend to diminish when the mother begins walking around. Real labor pains tend to increase with walking. 

Labor may also be signaled by a bloody discharge being expelled from the cervix. In one of eight pregnancies, the amniotic sac (water in which the fetus is suspended in the uterus) may break before labor begins. In such cases, the physician may induce labor with the use of medication if it does not begin on its own in order to reduce the risk of infection. Normally this sac does not rupture until the later stages of labor. 

The first stage of labor is typically the longest. During this stage the cervix or opening to the uterus dilates to 10 centimeters (just under 4 inches). This may take 12 to 16 hours for first children or about 6 to 9 hours for women who have previously given birth. Labor may also begin with a discharge of blood or amniotic fluid. 

### Labor: The Second and Third Stages

#### The Second Stage 

The second stage involves the passage of the baby through the birth canal. This stage takes about 10 to 40 minutes. Contractions usually come about every two to three minutes. The mother pushes and relaxes as directed by the medical staff. Normally the head is delivered first. The baby is then rotated so that one shoulder can come through and then the other shoulder. The rest of the baby quickly passes through. 

At this stage, an episiotomy (incision made in the tissue between the vaginal opening and anus) may be performed to avoid tearing the tissue of the back of the vaginal opening. The baby's mouth and nose are suctioned out. The umbilical cord is clamped and cut.

#### The Third Stage

The third stage is relatively painless. During this stage, the placenta or afterbirth is delivered, typically within 20 minutes after delivery. If an episiotomy was performed, it is stitched up during this stage. 

More than 50 percent of women giving birth at hospitals use an epidural anesthesia during delivery. An epidural block is a regional analgesic that can be used during labor and alleviates most pain in the lower body without slowing labor. The epidural block can be used throughout labor and has little to no effect on the baby. Medication is injected into a small space outside the spinal cord in the lower back. It takes 10 to 20 minutes for the medication to take effect. An epidural block with stronger medications, such as anesthetics, can be used shortly before a C-section or if a vaginal birth requires the use of forceps or vacuum extraction.

### Other Types of Deliveries

#### Cesarean Section

A **Cesarean section** (sometimes called a C-section) is surgery to deliver the baby through the mother's abdomen. In the United States, about one in three women have their babies delivered this way. Most C-sections are done when problems occur during delivery unexpectedly. These can include: 

- Health problems in the mother 
- Signs of distress in the baby 
- Not enough room for the baby to go through the vagina 
- A problematic position of the baby, such as a breech presentation where the head is not in the downward position 

C-sections are also more common among women carrying more than one baby. Although the surgery is relatively safe for mother and baby, it is considered major surgery and carries health risks. Additionally, it also takes longer to recover from a C-section than from vaginal birth. After healing, the incision may leave a weak spot in the wall of the uterus. This could cause problems with an attempted vaginal birth later. However, more than half of women who have a C-section can have a vaginal birth later. 

#### Induced Birth

Sometimes a baby’s arrival may need to be induced or delivered before labor begins. Inducing labor may be recommended for a variety of reasons when there is concern for the health of the mother or baby. For example: 

- The mother is approaching two weeks beyond her due date and labor has not started naturally. 
- The mother’s water has broken, but contractions have not begun. 
- There is an infection in the mother’s uterus. 
- The baby has stopped growing at the expected pace. 
- There is not enough amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. 
- The placenta peels away, either partially or completely, from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery. 

The mother has a medical condition that might put her or her baby at risk, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.

### Lesson 2: Introduction

This lesson addresses newborn assessment, concerns mothers might have after the baby is born, and overall physical growth and body proportions of newborn babies.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in physical growth and development during the newborn period.

### Assessing the Newborn

The APGAR assessment is conducted between one minute and five minutes after birth. This is a very quick way to assess the newborn's overall condition. Five measures are assessed: Activity (muscle tone, assessed by touching the baby's palm), Pulse (heart rate), Grimace (response to stimulation, such as stroking the foot), Appearance (the baby's color), and Respiration (breathing). A score of 0 to 2 is given on each feature examined. An APGAR score of 5 or less is cause for concern. The second APGAR should indicate improvement with a higher score.

Another way to assess the condition of the newborn is the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). The baby's motor development, muscle tone, and stress response are assessed. This tool has been used around the world to further assess the newborns, especially those with low APGAR scores, and to make comparisons of infants in different cultures (Brazelton & Nugent, 1995). This photo shows a newborn baby being assessed.

### Postpartum Maternal Concerns

After pregnancy, many women experience emotional changes. The **baby blues** are often mentioned as a common occurrence in new mothers. The baby blues are feelings of sadness that occur three to five days after having a baby and typically disappear, usually within 10 days of the birth. New mothers may have trouble sleeping, be moody, and feel letdown from the birthing experience. It is important to note that baby blues are not the same thing as **postpartum depression** (*postpartum* means "after the birth"). According to the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*, 5th edition, (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), postpartum depression**frequently occurs in the four weeks following pregnancy. Approximately one out of eight women experience postpartum depression and symptoms can include feelings of sadness, sleeplessness, and difficulty bonding with the newborn.

Changing hormone levels are thought to be a factor in the occurrence of postpartum depression. However, risk factors include having depression previously, a family history of depression, being younger than 20, experiencing stress, and substance use. Postpartum-onset mood disorders, both depression and mania, can occur with or without psychotic features. Hallucinations and delusions are associated with **postpartum psychosis** and have included command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed. Psychotic features occur in approximately one in 500 to 1,000 deliveries, and the risk is higher for women with prior postpartum mood episodes (APA, 2013).

**Postpartum anxiety** is also a concern for many new mothers. According to Bregel (2017), because oxytocin—a bonding hormone—rises during pregnancy, brain areas related to empathy and anxiety are heightened. Consequently, the new mother is "hard-wired" to respond to and fend for her baby, which can lead to toxic levels of stress and anxiety. These can appear as heightened alertness, intrusive and horrifying thoughts of something terrible happening to the infant, and physiological arousal. Just as for postpartum depression or postpartum psychosis, a new mother experiencing postpartum anxiety should seek assistance from a healthcare provider.

### Overall Physical Growth

The average newborn in the United States weighs about 7.5 pounds and about 20 inches in length. For the first few days of life, infants typically lose about 5 percent of their body weight as they eliminate waste and get used to feeding. This often goes unnoticed by most parents but can be cause for concern for those who have a smaller infant. This weight loss is temporary, however, and is followed by a rapid period of growth. By the time an infant is four months old, it usually doubles in weight and by one year has tripled the birth weight. By age two, the weight has quadrupled**,** so a two-year-old should weigh between 20 and 40 pounds. The average length at one year is about 29.5 inches and at two years, it is around 34.4 inches (Bloem, 2007).

### Body Proportions

Another dramatic physical change that takes place in the first several years of life is the change in body proportions. The head initially makes up about 50 percent of a baby's entire length when developing in the womb. At birth, the head makes up about 25 percent of the body's length, and by age 25 it comprises about 20 percent of length, or height.

### Next Step

Now move ahead to the next lesson.

### Lesson 3: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about the various stages in physical growth and development and explore the significant development milestones during early childhood related to sensing capabilities and nutrition.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in physical growth and development during early childhood.

### Motor Development

Motor development occurs in an orderly sequence as infants move from reflexive reactions (for example, sucking and rooting) to more advanced motor functioning. Development occurs along two paths: the **cephalocaudal path** (from head to tail) and the **proximodistal path** (from the midline outward). For instance, babies first learn to hold their heads up, then to sit with assistance, then to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling, pulling up, walking while holding on to something (called cruising), and then unassisted walking (Eisenberg et al., 1989).   
  
As motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young children should achieve. For each milestone there is an average age, as well as a range of ages, in which the milestone should be reached. An example of a developmental milestone is a baby holding up its head. Babies on average are able to hold up their heads at six weeks old, and 90 percent of babies achieve this between three weeks and four months old.   
  
On average, most babies sit alone at seven months old. Sitting involves both coordination and muscle strength, and 90 percent of babies achieve this milestone between five and nine months old. If the child is displaying delays on several milestones, that is reason for concern; and the parent or caregiver should discuss this with the child’s pediatrician. Developmental delays can be identified and addressed through early intervention.

#### Motor Skills

This refers to the ability to move the body and manipulate objects. **Fine motor skills** focus on the muscles in fingers, toes, and eyes, and enable coordination of small actions (for instance, grasping a toy, writing with a pencil, and using a spoon). Newborns cannot grasp objects voluntarily but do wave their arms toward objects of interest. At about four months of age, the infant is able to reach for an object, first with both arms and within a few weeks, with only one arm. At this age grasping an object involves the use of the fingers and palm, but no thumbs. This is known as the palmar grasp.

The use of the thumb comes at about nine months of age when the infant is able to grasp an object using the forefinger and thumb. Now the infant uses a pincer grasp, and this greatly enhances the ability to control and manipulate an object. Infants take great delight in this newfound ability. They may spend hours picking up small objects from the floor and placing them in containers. By nine months, an infant can also watch a moving object, reach for it as it approaches, and grab it. This photo shows a small child using a pincer grasp.

#### Gross Motor Skills

**Gross motor skills **focus on large muscle groups that control the head, torso, arms, and legs and involve larger movements (balancing, running, and jumping). These skills begin to develop first. Examples include moving to bring the chin up when lying on the stomach, moving the chest up, and rocking back and forth on hands and knees. However, it also includes exploring an object with one’s feet as many babies do as early as eight weeks of age if seated in a carrier or other device that frees the hips. This may be easier than reaching for an object with the hands, which requires much more practice (Berk, 2007). Sometimes an infant will try to move toward an object while crawling and, to its own surprise, move backward because of the greater amount of strength in the arms than in the legs.

- cephalocaudal path: development that proceeds from head to tail 
- proximodistal path: development that proceeds from the midline outward
- fine motor skills: those using the muscles in fingers, toes, and eyes, enabling coordination of small actions 
- **gross motor skills:** those using large muscle groups that control the head, torso, arms, and legs and involve larger movements

### Sensory Capacities

Throughout much of history, the newborn was considered a passive, disorganized being who possessed minimal abilities. William James, an early psychologist, had described the newborn’s world as “a blooming, buzzing confusion” (Shaffer, 1985). However, current research techniques have demonstrated just how developed the newborn is, especially its organized sensory and perceptual abilities.

#### Vision

The womb is a dark environment void of visual stimulation. Consequently, vision is one of the most poorly developed senses at birth, and time is needed to build those neural pathways between the eyes and the brain (American Optometric Association [AOA], 2019). Newborns typically cannot see farther than 8 to 10 inches away from their faces (AOA, 2019). An eight-week old’s vision is 20/300. This means an object 20 feet away from an infant has the same clarity as an object 300 feet away from an adult with normal vision. By three months, visual acuity has sharpened to 20/200, which would allow a baby to see the letter E at the top of a standard eye chart (Hamer, 2016). As a result, the world looks blurry to young infants (Johnson & deHaan, 2015). 

Why is visual acuity so poor in the infant? The part of the eye that makes up the central field of vision in the retina and allows people to see sharp detail is not fully developed at birth, and it does not start to reach adult levels of development until 15 months (Li & Ding, 2017). Even by 45 months, some of the sensory neurons (cones) of this part of the eye are still not fully grown. 

Can babies see color? Young infants can perceive color, but the colors need to be very pure forms of basic colors, such as vivid red or green rather than weaker pastel shades. Most studies report that babies can see the full spectrum of colors by five months of age (AOA, 2019).

Newborn infants prefer and orient to face-like stimuli more than they do other patterned stimuli (Farroni et al., 2005). They also prefer images of faces that are upright and not scrambled (Chien, 2011). Infants also quickly learn to distinguish the face of their mother from faces of other women (Bartrip et al., 2001). When viewing a person’s face, one-month-olds fixate on the outer edges of the face rather than the eyes, nose, or mouth, and two-month-olds gaze more at the inner features, especially the eyes (Hainline, 1978).

Researchers have examined the development of attention and tracking in the visual system and have found the following for young infants:

- One-month-olds have difficulty disengaging their attention and can spend several minutes fixedly gazing at a stimulus (Johnson & deHaan, 2015).
- Aslin (1981) found that when tracking an object visually, the eye movements of newborns and one-month olds are not smooth but step-like, jerky movements. Aslin also found their eye movements lag behind the object’s motion. This means young infants do not anticipate the trajectory of the object. By two months of age, their eye movements are becoming smoother, but they still lag behind the motion of the object and will not achieve this until about three to four months of age (Johnson & deHaan, 2015).
- Newborns also orient more to the visual field toward the side of the head than to the visual field on either side of the nose (Lewis et al., 1979). By two to three months, stimuli in both fields are now equally attended to (Johnson & deHaan, 2015).

**Binocular vision,** which requires input from both eyes, is evident around the third month and continues to develop during the first six months (Atkinson & Braddick, 2003). By six months infants can perceive depth perception in pictures as well (Sen et al., 2001). Infants who have experience crawling and exploring will pay greater attention to visual cues of depth and modify their actions accordingly (Berk, 2007).

#### Hearing

The infant’s sense of hearing is very keen at birth, and the ability to hear is evidenced as soon as the seventh month of prenatal development. Newborns prefer their mother’s voices over another female when speaking the same material (DeCasper & Fifer, 1980). Additionally, they will register in utero specific information heard from their mother’s or father's voice. Look at the fascinated expression on this baby's face as the father speaks.

DeCasper and Spence (1986) tested 16 infants (average age of 55.8 hours) whose mothers had previously read to them while still in the womb. The mothers read several passages to their fetuses, including the first 28 paragraphs of *The Cat in the Hat,* beginning when they were seven months pregnant. The fetuses had been exposed to the stories an average of 67 times. When the experimental infants were tested, the stories that had been previously heard were found to be more reinforcing than the novel story, measured by their rate of sucking, indicating that the experimental infants had heard the target stories before. However, for control infants, the target stories were not more reinforcing than the novel story.

An infant can distinguish between very similar sounds as early as one month after birth and can distinguish between a familiar and an unfamiliar voice even earlier. Infants are especially sensitive to the frequencies of sounds in human speech and prefer the exaggeration of infant-directed speech, which will be discussed later. Additionally, infants are innately ready to respond to the sounds of any language, but between six and nine months they show preference for listening to their native language (Jusczyk et al., 1993). Their ability to distinguish the sounds that are not in the language around them diminishes rapidly (Cheour-Luhtanen et al., 1995).

Touch and pain

Immediately after birth, a newborn is sensitive to touch and temperature, and is also highly sensitive to pain, responding with crying and cardiovascular responses (Balaban & Reisenauer, 2013). Newborns who are **circumcised **(had the foreskin of the penis surgically removed) without anesthesia experience pain, as demonstrated by increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, decreased oxygen in the blood, and a surge of stress hormones (United States National Library of Medicine, 2016). Research has demonstrated that infants who were circumcised without anesthesia experienced more pain and fear during routine childhood vaccines. Fortunately, today many local painkillers are used during circumcision.

#### Taste and smell

Studies of taste and smell demonstrate that babies respond with different facial expressions, suggesting that certain preferences are innate. Newborns can distinguish between sour, bitter, sweet, and salty flavors and show a preference for sweet flavors.

Newborns also prefer the smell of their mothers. An infant only six days old is significantly more likely to turn toward its own mother’s breast pad than to the breast pad of another baby’s mother (Porter et al., 1992) and, within hours of birth, an infant also shows a preference for the face of its own mother (Bushnell, 2001; Bushnell et al., 1989).

#### Intermodality

Infants seem to be born with the ability to perceive the world in an **intermodal** way; that is,**through stimulation from more than one sense, or mode. For example, infants who sucked on a pacifier with either a smooth or textured surface preferred to look at a corresponding (smooth or textured) visual model of the pacifier. By four months, infants can match lip movements with speech sounds and can match other audiovisual events. Sensory processes are certainly affected by the infant's developing motor abilities (Hyvärinen et al., 2014). Reaching, crawling, and other actions allow the infant to see, touch, and organize their experiences in new ways.

### How Infants Are Tested

**Habituation procedures,** meaning procedures that measure decreased responsiveness to a stimulus after repeated presentations*,* have increasingly been used to evaluate infants to study the development of perceptual and memory skills. Phelps (2005) describes a habituation procedure used when measuring the rate of the sucking reflex.

Researchers first measure the initial baseline rate of sucking to a pacifier equipped with transducers that measure muscle contractions. Next, an auditory stimulus is presented, such as a human voice uttering a speech sound such as “da.” The rate of sucking will typically increase with the new sound, but then decrease to baseline levels as “da” is repeatedly presented, showing habituation. If the sound “ma” was then presented, the rate of sucking would again increase, demonstrating that the infant can discriminate between these two stimuli.

Additionally, the speed or efficiency with which infants show habituation has been shown to predict outcomes in behaviors, such as language acquisition and verbal and nonverbal intelligence. Infants who show difficulty during habituation, or habituate at slower than normal rates, have been found to be at an increased risk for significant developmental delays. Infants with Down syndrome, teratogen-exposed infants, malnourished infants, and premature infants have all been studied. Researchers have found that at the age of 16 months, high-risk infants show rates of habituation comparable to newborn infants (Phelps, 2005).

### Breast Milk

Breast milk is considered the ideal diet for newborns. **Colostrum,** the first breast milk produced during pregnancy and just after birth, has been described as “liquid gold” (United States Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2011). It is very rich in nutrients and antibodies. Breast milk changes by the third to fifth day after birth, becoming much thinner, but containing just the right amount of fat, sugar, water, and proteins to support overall physical and neurological development.   
  
For most babies, breast milk is also easier to digest than formula. Formula-fed infants experience more diarrhea and upset stomachs. The absence of antibodies in formula often results in a higher rate of ear infections and respiratory infections. Children who are breastfed have lower rates of childhood leukemia, asthma, obesity, Types 1 and 2 diabetes, and a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The USDHHS recommends that mothers breastfeed their infants until at least six months of age, and that breast milk be used in the diet throughout the first year or two.

#### Breastfeeding Benefits

Several recent studies have reported that it is not just babies that benefit from breastfeeding. Breastfeeding stimulates contractions in the uterus to help it regain its normal size, and women who breastfeed are more likely to space their pregnancies farther apart. Mothers who breastfeed are at a lower risk of developing breast cancer (Islami et al., 2015), especially among higher risk racial and ethnic groups (Islami et al., 2015; Redondo et al., 2012). Women who breastfeed have lower rates of ovarian cancer (Titus-Ernstoff et al., 2010), reduced risk for developing Type 2 diabetes (Schwarz et al., 2010; Gunderson et al., 2015), and rheumatoid arthritis (Karlson et al., 2004). In most studies, these benefits have been seen in women who breastfeed longer than six months.

Current rates of breastfeeding indicate that 83.2% of mothers have breastfed their infants at some point (CDC, 2018). However, most mothers who breastfeed in the United States stop breastfeeding exclusively at about six to eight weeks, often in order to return to work outside the home (USDHHS, 2011). Mothers can certainly continue to provide breast milk to their babies by expressing and freezing the milk to be bottle fed at a later time or by being available to their infants at feeding time.

However, some mothers find that after the initial encouragement they receive in the hospital to breastfeed, the outside world is less supportive of such efforts. Some workplaces support breastfeeding mothers by providing flexible schedules and welcoming infants, but many do not. In addition, not all women may be able to breastfeed. Women with HIV are routinely discouraged from breastfeeding as the infection may pass to the infant. Similarly, women who are taking certain medications or undergoing radiation treatment may be told not to breastfeed (USDHHS, 2011).

Besides the nutritional benefits of breastfeeding, breast milk is free. Anyone who has priced formula recently can appreciate this added incentive to breastfeeding. Prices for a year’s worth of formula and feeding supplies can cost between $1,500 and $3,000 per year (Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, 2019). In addition to the formula, costs include bottles, nipples, sterilizers, and other supplies.

One early argument given to promote the practice of breastfeeding was that it promoted bonding and healthy emotional development for infants. However, this does not seem to be the case. Breastfed and bottle-fed infants adjust equally well emotionally (Ferguson & Woodward, 1999). This is good news for mothers who may be unable to breastfeed for a variety of reasons and for fathers who might feel left out.

### When to Introduce More Solid Foods

Solid foods should not be introduced until the infant is ready. According to The Clemson University Cooperative Extension (2014), some things to look for include that the infant:

- can sit up without needing support,
- can hold its head up without wobbling,
- shows interest in foods others are eating,
- is still hungry after being breastfed or formula fed,
- is able to move foods from the front to the back of the mouth, and
- is able to turn away when they have had enough. 

For many infants who are four to six months of age, breast milk or formula can be supplemented with more solid foods. The first semi-solid foods that are introduced are iron-fortified infant cereals mixed with breast milk or formula. Typically rice, oatmeal, and barley cereals are offered as a number of infants are sensitive to more wheat-based cereals. Finger foods such as toast squares, cooked vegetable strips, or peeled soft fruit can be introduced by 10 to 12 months.   
  
New foods should be introduced one at a time, and the new food should be fed for a few days in a row to allow the baby time to adjust to the new food. This also allows parents time to assess if the child has a food allergy. Foods that have multiple ingredients should be avoided until parents have assessed how the child responds to each ingredient separately. Foods that are sticky (such as peanut butter or taffy), cut into large chunks (such as cheese and harder meats), and firm and round (such as hard candies, grapes, or cherry tomatoes) should be avoided as they are a choking hazard. Honey and corn syrup should be avoided as these often contain botulism spores. In children under 12 months, this can lead to death (Clemson University Cooperative Extension, 2014).

### Global Considerations and Malnutrition

Children in developing countries and countries experiencing the harsh conditions of war are at risk for two major types of malnutrition, also referred to as wasting. **Infantile marasmus** refers to starvation due to a lack of calories and protein. Children who do not receive adequate nutrition lose fat and muscle until their bodies can no longer function. Babies who are breastfed are much less at risk of malnutrition than those who are bottle-fed.

After weaning, children who have diets deficient in protein may experience **kwashiorkor,** known as the “disease of the displaced child,” often occurring after another child has been born and taken over breastfeeding. This results in a loss of appetite and swelling of the abdomen as the body begins to break down the vital organs as a source of protein.

**Malnutrition Rates**

Around the world, the rates of wasting have been dropping. However, according to the World Health Organization and UNICEF, in 2014 there were 50 million children under the age of five that experienced these forms of wasting, and 16 million were severely wasted (UNICEF, 2015). This works out to one child in every 13 who suffers from some form of wasting, and the majority of these children live in Asia (34.3 million) and Africa (13.9 million). Wasting can occur as a result of severe food shortages, regional diets that lack certain proteins and vitamins, or infectious diseases that inhibit appetite (Latham, 1997).

The consequences of wasting depend on how late in the progression of the disease parents and guardians seek medical treatment for their children. Unfortunately, in some cultures, families do not seek treatment early and, as a result, by the time a child is hospitalized the child often dies within the first three days after admission (Latham, 1997). Several studies have reported long-term cognitive effects of early malnutrition (Galler & Ramsey, 1989; Galler et al., 1987; Richardson, 1980), even when home environments were controlled (Galler et al., 1990). Lower intelligence scores (Galler et al., 1987), poor attention (Galler & Ramsey, 1989), and behavioral issues in the classroom (Galler et al., 1990) have been reported in children with a history of serious malnutrition in the first few years of life.

### Next Step

Now move ahead to the next lesson.

### Lesson 4: Introduction

Individuals develop based on the hereditary characteristics that they inherit from their parents, in the form of genes. The overall cognitive development of a child is influenced by several factors, including genes, prenatal nutrition, and other factors.

Genetic disorders can therefore be either a result of combination of gene sets or prenatal conditions that influence genes. In this lesson, you will focus on the meaning of hereditary factors that influence cognitive development of a child, along with some common genetic disorders and their causes.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Describe the significance of genetic influences on the future cognitive development of a human embryo and fetus.

### Heredity

The basic building block of the nature perspective is the **gene**. Genes, which are the basic physical units of inheritance, passed from parents to offspring, control the manufacture of proteins in the body, responsible for influencing the structure and functions of cells. Genes are located on the **chromosomes **and there are an estimated 20,500 genes for humans, according to the Human Genome Project (NIH, 2015). This illustration shows the relationship from DNA to chromosome to cell.

Normal human cells contain 46 chromosomes (23 pairs, one set from each parent) in the nuclei of the cells. After conception, most cells of the body are created by a process called **mitosis**. Mitosis is defined as the cell's nucleus making an exact copy of all the chromosomes and splitting into two new cells. However, the cells used in sexual reproduction, called the **gametes **(sperm or ova), are formed in a process called meiosis.

In **meiosis**, the gamete's chromosomes duplicate and then divide twice, resulting in four cells containing only half the genetic material of the original gamete. Thus, each sperm and egg possesses only 23 chromosomes that combine to produce the normal 46. Given the number of genes present and the unpredictability of the meiosis process, the likelihood of having offspring that are genetically identical (and not twins) is one in trillions (Gould & Keeton, 1997). This illustration shows the process of mitosis.

Of the 23 pairs of chromosomes created at conception, 22 pairs are similar in length. The remaining pair, or **sex chromosomes**, may differ in length. If a child receives the combination of XY, the child will be genetically male. If the child receives the combination XX, the child will be genetically female. This illustration shows the process of meiosis, as a fertilized ovum begins to change into a multi-celled organism.

### Genotypes and Phenotypes

The word **genotype** refers to the sum total of all the genes a person inherits. The word **phenotype** refers to the features that are actually expressed. Look in the mirror. What do you see, your genotype or your phenotype? What determines whether or not genes are expressed? Because genes are inherited in pairs on the chromosomes, you may receive either the same version of a gene from your mother and father, that is, be **homozygous** for that characteristic the gene influences. If you receive a different version of the gene from each parent, that is referred to as **heterozygous**. In the homozygous situation, you will display that characteristic. It is in the heterozygous condition that it becomes clear that not all genes are created equal. 

Some genes are **dominant**, meaning that they express themselves in the phenotype, even when paired with a different version of the gene, while their silent partner is called recessive. **Recessive** genes express themselves only when paired with a similar version gene. Some dominant traits include having facial dimples, curly hair, normal vision, and dark hair. Some recessive traits include red hair, being nearsighted, and straight hair.

Most characteristics are not the result of a single gene; they are **polygenic**, meaning that they are the result of several genes. In addition, the dominant and recessive patterns described above are usually not that simple either. Sometimes the dominant gene does not completely suppress the recessive gene; this is called **incomplete dominance**.

An example of this can be found in the recessive gene disorder of sickle cell disease. The gene that produces healthy round-shaped red blood cells is dominant. The recessive gene causes an abnormality in the shape of red blood cells; they take on a sickle form, which can clog the veins and deprive vital organs of oxygen and increase the risk of stroke. To inherit the disorder, a person must receive the recessive gene from both parents. Those who have inherited only one recessive gene, carriers of the recessive trait, should be unaffected by it. Yet, carriers of sickle cell have some red blood cells that take on the C-shaped sickle pattern. Under circumstances of oxygen deprivation, such as high altitudes or physical exertion, carriers for the sickle cell gene may experience some of the symptoms of sickle cell disease (Berk, 2004).

### Monozygotic and Dizygotic Twins  

Many students are interested in twins. Monozygotic or identical twins occur when a fertilized egg splits apart in the first two weeks of development. The result is the creation of two separate, but genetically identical offspring. That is, they possess the same genotype and often the same phenotype. About one-third of twins are monozygotic twins. Sometimes, however, two eggs or ova are released and fertilized by two separate sperm. The result is dizygotic or fraternal twins. These two individuals share the same amount of genetic material as would any two children from the same mother and father. In other words, they possess a different genotype and phenotype. Older mothers are more likely to have dizygotic twins than are younger mothers, and couples who use fertility drugs are also more likely to give birth to dizygotic twins. Consequently, there has been an increase in the number of fraternal twins recently (Bortolus et al., 1999).

### Genetic Disorders

Most of the known genetic disorders are **dominant gene–linked**; however, the vast majority of dominant gene–linked disorders are not serious or debilitating. For example, the majority of those with Tourette's syndrome suffer only minor tics from time to time and can easily control their symptoms. Huntington's disease is a dominant gene–linked disorder that affects the nervous system and is fatal but does not appear until midlife. Recessive gene disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia, are less common but may actually claim more lives because they are less likely to be detected, as people are unaware that they are carriers of the disease.   
  
Some genetic disorders are **sex-linked**; the defective gene is found on the X chromosome. Males have only one X chromosome, so they are at greater risk for sex-linked disorders due to a recessive gene, such as hemophilia, color-blindness, and baldness. For females to be affected by the genetic defects, they need to inherit the recessive gene on both X chromosomes, but if the defective gene is dominant, females can be equally at risk.

**Recessive Disorders (Homozygous): **The individual inherits a gene change from both parents. If the gene is inherited from just one parent, the person is a carrier and does not have the condition.
- **Sickle cell disease** (SCD) is a condition in which the red blood cells in the body are shaped like a sickle (like the letter C) and affect the ability of the blood to transport oxygen. Carriers may experience some effects, but do not have the full condition.

- **Achondroplasia **is the most common form of disproportionate short stature. The individual has abnormal bone growth resulting in short stature, disproportionately short arms and legs, short fingers, a large head, and specific facial features.
1 in 15,000-40,000 births**Sex-Linked Disorders:  **When the X chromosome carries the mutated gene, the disorder is referred to as an X-linked disorder. Males are more affected than females because they possess only one X chromosome without an additional X chromosome to counter the harmful gene.
- **Fragile X syndrome **occurs when the body cannot make enough of a protein it needs for the brain to grow and problems with learning and behavior can occur. Fragile X syndrome is caused from an abnormality in the X chromosome, which then breaks. If a female has fragile X, her second X chromosome usually is healthy, but males with fragile X do not have a second healthy X chromosome. This is why symptoms of fragile X syndrome usually are more serious in males.

### Chromosomal Abnormalities

A **chromosomal abnormality** occurs when a child inherits too many or too few chromosomes. The most common cause of chromosomal abnormalities is the age of the mother. As the mother ages, the ovum is more likely to suffer abnormalities due to longer term exposure to environmental factors. Consequently, some gametes do not divide evenly when they are forming. Therefore, some cells have more than 46 chromosomes. In fact, it is believed that close to half of all zygotes have an odd number of chromosomes. Most of these zygotes fail to develop and are spontaneously aborted by the mother's body.

One of the most common chromosomal abnormalities is on pair 21. **Trisomy 21**, or **Down syndrome**, occurs when there are three rather than two 21st chromosomes. A person with Down syndrome typically exhibits an intellectual disability and possesses certain physical features, such as short fingers and toes, folds of skin over the eyes, and a protruding tongue. There is as much variation in people with Down syndrome as in most populations, and those differences need to be recognized and appreciated. Other less common chromosomal abnormalities of live-born infants occur on chromosome 13 and chromosome 18. 

When the abnormality is on the 23rd pair, the result is a **sex-linked chromosomal****abnormality.** A person might have XXY, XYY, XXX, XO. Two of the more common sex-linked chromosomal disorders are **Turner syndrome **and **Klinefelter syndrome**.   
**  
**Turner syndrome occurs when part or all of one of the X chromosome is lost and the resulting zygote has an XO composition. This occurs in 1 out of every 2,500 live female births (Carroll, 2007) and affects the individual's cognitive functioning and sexual maturation. The external genitalia appear normal, but breasts and ovaries do not develop fully and the woman does not menstruate. Turner syndrome also results in short stature and other physical characteristics.   
  
Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) results when an extra X chromosome is present in the cells of a male and occurs in 1 out of every 650 live male births. The Y chromosome stimulates the growth of male genitalia, but the additional X chromosome inhibits this development. An individual with Klinefelter syndrome typically has small testes, some breast development, infertility, and low levels of testosterone (National Institutes of Health, 2019).

### Prenatal Brain Development

**Prenatal** brain development begins in the third gestational week with the differentiation of stem cells, which are capable of producing all the different cells that make up the brain (Stiles & Jernigan, 2010). By the end of the third week, the brain begins to develop and by the end of the embryonic period, or week 8, the brain has further differentiated into its primary parts: the **forebrain**, **midbrain**, and **hindbrain**.

Brain development during the fetal period involves neuron production, migration, and differentiation. From the early fetal period until mid-gestation, most of the 85 billion neurons have been generated, and many have already migrated to their brain positions. The formation of **neurons** (brain cells) is largely completed after five months of gestation. One exception is in the **hippocampus**, which continues to develop neurons throughout life. Neurons that form the layer of cells that lie on the surface of the brain, migrate to their location in an orderly way. Neural migration is mostly completed in the **cerebral cortex** by 24 weeks (Poduri & Volpe, 2018).

Once in position, neurons begin to form the neural networks responsible for information processing. Regions of the brain that contain the cell bodies are referred to as the **gray matter** because they are gray in appearance. The **axons** that form the neural pathways make up the **white matter** because they are covered in **myelin**, a fatty substance that is white in appearance. Myelin aids in both the insulation and efficiency of neural transmission. Although cell differentiation is complete at birth, the growth of **dendrites**, axons, and **synapses** continue for years.

### Teratogens

Good prenatal care is essential. The developing child is most at risk for some of the severe problems during the first three months of development. Unfortunately, this is a time at which many mothers are unaware that they are pregnant. Today, many of the factors that can jeopardize the health of the developing child are known. The study of factors that contribute to birth defects is called **teratology. Teratogens** are environmental factors that can contribute to birth defects and include some maternal diseases, pollutants, drugs, and alcohol.

#### Factors Influencing Prenatal Risks

There are several considerations in determining the type and amount of damage that might result from exposure to a particular teratogen (Berger, 2005). These include:

- **The timing of the exposure:** Structures in the body are vulnerable to the most severe damage when they are forming. If a substance is introduced during a particular structure's critical period (time of development), the damage to that structure may be greater. For example, the ears and arms reach their critical periods at about six weeks after conception. If a mother exposes the embryo to certain substances during this period, the arms and ears may be malformed.
- **The amount of exposure:** Some substances are not harmful unless the amounts reach a certain level. The critical level depends in part on the size and metabolism of the mother.
- **The number of teratogens:** Fetuses exposed to multiple teratogens typically have more problems than those exposed to only one.
- **Genetics:** Genetic make-up also plays a role on the impact a particular teratogen might have on the child. This is suggested by fraternal twins exposed to the same prenatal environment, but they do not experience the same teratogenic effects. The genetic make-up of the mother can also have an effect; some mothers may be more resistant to teratogenic effects than others.
- **Being male or female:** Males are more likely to experience damage due to teratogens than are females. It is believed that the Y chromosome, which contains fewer genes than the X, may have an impact.

#### Alcohol

One of the most commonly used teratogens is alcohol, and because half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, it is recommended that women of child-bearing age take great caution against drinking alcohol when not using birth control or when pregnant (CDC, 2005). Alcohol use during pregnancy is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities in children in the United States (Maier & West, 2001). Alcohol consumption, particularly during the second month of prenatal development but at any point during pregnancy, may lead to neurocognitive and behavioral difficulties that can last a lifetime.

In extreme cases, alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to fetal death but it also can result in **fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD)**, which is an umbrella term for the range of effects that can occur due to alcohol consumption during pregnancy (March of Dimes, 2016a). The most severe form of FASD is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Children with FAS share certain physical features such as flattened noses, small eye holes, and small heads. Cognitively, these children have poor judgment, poor impulse control, higher rates of ADHD, learning issues, and lower IQ scores. These developmental problems and delays persist into adulthood (Streissguth et al, 1996) and can include criminal behavior, psychiatric problems, and unemployment (CDC, 2016a).   
  
Based on animal studies, it has been hypothesized that a mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy may predispose her child to like alcohol (Youngentob et al., 2007). **Binge drinking** during pregnancy, having four or more drinks in the space of two to three hours, increases the chance of having a baby with FASD (March of Dimes, 2016a).

#### Tobacco

Another widely used teratogen is tobacco as more than 7 percent of pregnant women smoked in 2016 (Someji & Beltrán-Sánchez, 2019). According to Tong et al. (2013), in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, data from 27 sites in 2010 representing 52 percent of live births showed that, among women with recent live births:

- About 23 percent reported smoking in the three months prior to pregnancy
- Almost 11 percent reported smoking during pregnancy
- More than half (54.3 percent) reported that they quit smoking by the last three months of pregnancy
- Almost 16 percent reported smoking after delivery

When comparing the ages of women who smoked:

- Women under 20: 13.6 percent smoked during pregnancy
- Women 20–24: 17.6 percent smoked during pregnancy
- Women 25–34: 8.8 percent smoked during pregnancy
- Women 35 and older: 5.7 percent smoked during pregnancy

The findings among racial and ethnic groups indicated that smoking during pregnancy was highest among American Indians/Alaska Natives (26.0 percent) and lowest among Asians/Pacific Islanders (2.1 percent).

When a pregnant woman smokes, the fetus is exposed to dangerous chemicals, including nicotine, carbon monoxide, and tar, which lessen the amount of oxygen available to the fetus. Oxygen is important for overall growth and development. Tobacco use during pregnancy has been associated with low birth weight, ectopic pregnancy (fertilized egg implants itself outside of the uterus), placenta previa (placenta lies low in the uterus and covers all or part of the cervix), placental abruption (placenta separates prematurely from the uterine wall), preterm delivery, stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), birth defects, learning disabilities, and early puberty in girls (CDC, 2015d).

A woman's being exposed to secondhand smoke during pregnancy has also been linked to low-birth-weight infants. In addition, exposure to toxins from tobacco smoke that linger on clothing, furniture, and in locations where smoking has occurred results in a negative impact on infants' lung development. Rehan et al. (2011) found that prenatal exposure to this sort of tobacco smoke played a greater role in altered lung functioning in children than exposure following birth.

#### Prescription/Over-the-Counter Drugs

About 70 percent of pregnant women take at least one prescription drug (March of Dimes, 2016e). A woman should not be taking any prescription drug during pregnancy unless it was prescribed by a healthcare provider who knows she is pregnant. Some prescription drugs can cause birth defects and problems in the overall health and development of the fetus. Over-the-counter drugs are also a concern during the prenatal period because they may cause certain health problems. For example, the pain reliever ibuprofen can cause serious blood flow problems to the fetus during the last three months.

#### Illicit Drugs

Common illicit drugs include cocaine, ecstasy and other club drugs, heroin, marijuana, and prescription drugs that are abused. It is difficult to completely determine the effects of a particular illicit drug on a developing child because most mothers who use tend to use more than one substance and have other unhealthy behaviors. These include smoking, drinking alcohol, not eating healthy meals, and being more likely to get a sexually transmitted disease.   
  
However, several problems seem clear. The use of cocaine is connected with low birth weight, stillbirths, and spontaneous abortion. Heavy marijuana use is associated with problems in brain development (March of Dimes, 2016c). If a baby's mother used an addictive drug during pregnancy, that baby can get addicted to the drug before birth and go through drug withdrawal after birth, also known as **neonatal abstinence syndrome** (March of Dimes, 2015d).   
  
Other complications of illicit drug use include premature birth, smaller than normal head size, birth defects, heart defects, and infections. Additionally, babies born to mothers who use drugs may have problems later in life (including learning and behavior difficulties), have slower than normal growth, and die from sudden infant death syndrome. Children of substance abusing parents are also considered at high risk for a range of biological, developmental, academic, and behavioral problems, including developing substance abuse problems of their own (Conners et al., 2003).

#### Pollutants

There are more than 83,000 chemicals used in the United States with little information on the effects of them during pregnancy (March of Dimes, 2016b).

- **Lead:** An environmental pollutant of significant concern is lead poisoning, which has been linked to fertility problems, high blood pressure, low birth weight, prematurity, miscarriage, and slowed neurological development. Grossman and Slutsky (2017) found that babies born in Flint, Michigan, an area identified with high lead levels in the drinking water, were premature, weighed less than the average, and gained less weight than expected.
- **Pesticides:** The chemicals in certain pesticides are also potentially damaging and may lead to birth defects, learning problems, low birth weight, miscarriage, and premature birth (March of Dimes, 2014).
- **Bisphenol A:** Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical commonly used in plastics and food and beverage containers, may disrupt the action of certain genes contributing to certain birth defects (March of Dimes, 2016b).
- **Radiation:** If a mother is exposed to radiation, it can get into the bloodstream and pass through the umbilical cord to the baby. Radiation can also build up in body areas close to the uterus, such as the bladder. Exposure to radiation can slow the baby's growth, cause birth defects, affect brain development, cause cancer, and result in a miscarriage.
- **Mercury:** Mercury, a heavy metal, can cause brain damage and affect the baby's hearing and vision. This is why women are cautioned about the amount and type of fish they consume during pregnancy.

#### Toxoplasmosis

The tiny parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, causes an infection called toxoplasmosis. According to the March of Dimes (2012d), Toxoplasma gondii infects more than 60 million people in the United States. A healthy immune system can keep the parasite at bay, producing no symptoms, so most people do not know that they are infected. As a routine prenatal screening frequently does not test for the presence of this parasite, pregnant women may want to talk to their healthcare provider about being tested.   
  
Toxoplasmosis can cause premature birth, stillbirth, and can result in birth defects to the eyes and brain. While most babies born with this infection show no symptoms, 10 percent may experience eye infections, enlarged liver and spleen, jaundice, and pneumonia. To avoid being infected, women should avoid eating undercooked or raw meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables, touching cooking utensils that touched raw meat or unwashed fruits and vegetables, and touching cat feces, soil, or sand. If women think they may have been infected during pregnancy, they should have their babies tested.

#### Sexually Transmitted Diseases

Gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia are sexually transmitted infections that can be passed to the fetus by an infected mother. Mothers should be tested as early as possible to minimize the risk of spreading these infections to their unborn child. Additionally, the earlier the treatment begins, the better the health outcomes for mother and baby (CDC, 2016d).   
  
Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can cause premature birth, premature rupture of the amniotic sac, an ectopic pregnancy, birth defects, miscarriage, and stillbirths (March of Dimes, 2013). Most babies become infected with STDs while passing through the birth canal during delivery, but some STDs can cross the placenta and infect the developing fetus.

#### Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

One of the most potentially devastating teratogens is HIV. HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are significant causes of illness and death in the United States (Health Resources and Services Administration, 2015). One of the main ways children under age 13 become infected with HIV is via mother-to-child transmission of the virus prenatally, during labor, or by breastfeeding (CDC, 2016c).   
  
There are some measures that can be taken to lower the chance the child will contract the disease. HIV-positive mothers who take antiviral medications during their pregnancy greatly reduce the chance of passing the virus to the fetus. The risk of transmission is less than 2 percent; in contrast, it is 25 percent if the mother does not take antiretroviral drugs (CDC, 2016b). However, the long-term risks of prenatal exposure to the medication are not known. It is recommended that women with HIV deliver the child by cesarean section, and that after birth they avoid breastfeeding.

#### German Measles (Rubella)

Rubella, also called German measles, is an infection that causes mild flu-like symptoms and a rash on the skin. However, only about half of children infected have these symptoms, while others have no symptoms (March of Dimes, 2012a). Rubella has been associated with a number of birth defects. If the mother contracts the disease during the first three months of pregnancy, damage can occur in the eyes, ears, heart, or brain of the unborn child. Deafness is almost certain if the mother has German measles before the 11th week of prenatal development and can also cause brain damage. Women in the United States are much less likely to be afflicted with rubella because most women received childhood vaccinations that protect them from the disease.

### Lesson 5: Introduction

All neonatal stages mark a different stage of development for an individual's growth. Newborns and infants have specific cognitive growth curves, and several factors can affect these curves. The presence and maturation of a newborn's reflexes can help pediatricians evaluate an infant's neurodevelopmental growth.

In this lesson, you will learn about the neurodevelopment of a newborn, the factors that affect it, and the effects it has on developmental milestones throughout childhood.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in cognitive development during the newborn period.

### Neural Development During Infancy

Some of the most dramatic physical change that occurs during this period is in the brain. People are born with most of the brain cells that they will ever have; that is, about 85 billion neurons whose function is to store and transmit information (Huttenlocher & Dabholkar, 1997). While most of the brain's neurons are present at birth, they are not fully mature. During the next several years, dendrites, or branching extensions that collect information from other neurons, will undergo a period of exuberance. Because of this proliferation of dendrites, by age two, a single neuron might have thousands of dendrites.

**Synaptogenesis,** or the formation of connections between neurons, continues from the prenatal period forming thousands of new connections during infancy and toddlerhood. This period of rapid neural growth is referred to as **synaptic blooming.**
[Opens in new tab](https://assets.wgu.edu/364e6695c2ad6ef18d3572649c7d10a0)"[Nerve cells and electrical pulses. 3d illustration Opens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.in/detail/photo/nerve-cells-and-electrical-pulses-3d-illustration-royalty-free-image/1344765700)" by Mohammed Haneefa Nizamudeen, [Getty Images Content License AgreementOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.com/eula#RF)
The blooming period of neural growth is followed by a period of **synaptic pruning,** where neural connections are reduced, making those used much stronger. It is thought that pruning causes the brain to function more efficiently, allowing for mastery of more complex skills (Kolb & Whishaw, 2011). Experience will shape which of these connections are maintained and which of these are lost. Ultimately, about 40 percent of these connections will be lost (Webb et al., 2001). Blooming occurs during the first few years of life, and pruning continues through childhood and into adolescence in various areas of the brain.

Another major change occurring in the central nervous system is the development of myelin, a coating of fatty tissues around the axon of the neuron (Carlson, 2014). Myelin helps insulate the nerve cell and speed the rate of transmission of impulses from one cell to another. This enhances the building of neural pathways and improves coordination and control of movement and thought processes. The development of myelin continues into adolescence but is most dramatic during the first several years of life.

### Neural Development and Functional Growth

The infant brain grows very fast. At birth, the brain is about 250 grams (half a pound), and by one year, it is already 750 grams (Eliot, 1999). Compared to adult size, the newborn brain is approximately 33 percent of adult size at birth, and in just 90 days, it is already at 55 percent of adult size (Holland et al., 2014).   
  
Most of the neural activity is occurring in the cortex or the thin outer covering of the brain involved in voluntary activity and thinking. The cortex is divided into two hemispheres, and each hemisphere is divided into four lobes, each separated by folds known as fissures. Look at the cortex starting at the front of the brain and then over the top.

In addition, it shows the cerebellum with the description balance coordination and the brain stem with the description heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure, and swallowing."[Digital illustration of human Brain, lobe, lobes, anatomy, 3D rendering - stock photoOpens in new tab]("https://www.gettyimages.in/detail/photo/digital-illustration-of-human-brain-lobe-lobes-royalty-free-image/1227575331?adppopup=true")" by Martin Broz, [Getty Images Content License AgreementOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.com/eula#RF)
The **frontal lobe, **behind the forehead, is responsible primarily for thinking, planning, memory, and judgment. The **parietal lobe,** which extends from the middle to the back of the skull, is responsible primarily for processing information about touch. The **occipital lobe** at the very back of the skull processes visual information. In front of the occipital lobe between the ears is the **temporal lobe,** responsible for hearing and language (Jarrett, 2015).  
  
Although the brain grows rapidly during infancy, specific brain regions do not mature at the same rate. Primary motor areas develop earlier than primary sensory areas, and the prefrontal cortex, located behind the forehead, is the least developed (Giedd, 2015). As the prefrontal cortex matures, the child is increasingly able to regulate or control emotions, plan activities, strategize, and have better judgment. This is not fully accomplished in infancy and toddlerhood but continues throughout childhood, adolescence, and into adulthood.

#### Lateralization

**Lateralization** is the process in which different functions become localized primarily on one side of the brain. For example, in most adults, the left hemisphere is more active than the right during language production, while the reverse pattern is observed during tasks involving visuospatial abilities (Springer & Deutsch, 1993). This process develops over time; however, structural asymmetries between the hemispheres have been reported even in fetuses (Chi et al., 1997; Kasprian et al., 2011) and infants (Dubois et al., 2009).   
  
Lastly, **neuroplasticity** refers to the brain's ability to change, both physically and chemically, to enhance its adaptability to environmental change and compensate for injury. The control of some specific bodily functions, such as movement, vision, and hearing, is performed in specified areas of the cortex. If these areas are damaged, the individual will likely lose the ability to perform the corresponding function.   
  
The brain's neurons have a remarkable capacity to reorganize and extend themselves to carry out these particular functions in response to the organism's needs and repair any damage. As a result, the brain constantly creates new neural communication routes and rewires existing ones. Both environmental experiences, such as stimulation, and events within a person's body, such as hormones and genes, affect the brain's plasticity. So too does age. Adult brains demonstrate neuroplasticity, but they are influenced less extensively than those of infants (Kolb & Fantie, 1989; Kolb & Whishaw, 2011).

### Sleep Time at Different Ages

A newborn typically sleeps about 16.5 hours per 24-hour period, during several sleep periods throughout the day. (Salkind, 2005). The infant is averaging 15 hours per 24-hour period by one month and 14 hours by six months. By the time children turn two, they are averaging closer to 10 hours of sleep per 24 hours. Additionally, the average newborn will spend close to 50 percent of its sleep time in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase, which decreases to 25–30 percent in childhood.

### Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths (SUID)

Each year in the United States, there are about 3,500 sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID). These deaths occur among infants less than one-year-old and have no immediately obvious cause (CDC, 2019). The three commonly reported types of SUID are:

- **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS):** SIDS is identified when the death of a healthy infant occurs suddenly and unexpectedly, and medical and forensic investigation findings (including an autopsy) are inconclusive. SIDS is the leading cause of death in infants 1 to 12 months old, and approximately 1,400 infants died of SIDS in 2017 (CDC, 2019).   
  
Because SIDS is diagnosed when no other cause of death can be determined, possible causes of SIDS are regularly researched. One leading hypothesis suggests that infants who die from SIDS have abnormalities in the area of the brainstem responsible for regulating breathing (Weekes-Shackelford & Shackelford, 2005).  
  

- **Unknown Cause:** This type of SUID is the sudden death of an infant less than one year of age that cannot be explained because a thorough investigation was not conducted, and cause of death could not be determined. In 2017, 1,300 infants died from unknown causes (CDC, 2019).   
  

- **Accidental Suffocation and Strangulation in Bed:** Reasons for accidental suffocation include suffocation by soft bedding, another person rolling on top of or against the infant while sleeping, an infant being wedged between two objects such as a mattress and wall, and strangulation, such as when an infant's head and neck become caught between crib railings. In 2017, 900 infants died from accidental suffocation and strangulation.

The combined SUID death rate declined considerably following the release of the American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep recommendations in 1992, which advocated that infants be placed for sleep on their backs (non-prone position).

These recommendations were followed by a major "Back to Sleep" campaign in 1994. However, accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed mortality rates remained unchanged until the late 1990s. In 1998, death rates from accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed actually started to increase, and they reached the highest rate at 24.6 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2017 (CDC, 2019).   
  

#### Should infants be sharing the bed with parents? 

Colvin et al. (2014) analyzed a total of 8,207 deaths from 24 states during 2004–2012 that were contained in the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths Case Reporting System, a database of death reports from state child death review teams.   
  
The results indicated that younger victims (0–3 months) were more likely to die by bed-sharing and sleeping in an adult bed or on a person. A higher percentage of older victims (4 months to 364 days) rolled into objects in the sleep environment and changed position from side or back to prone.   
  
Carpenter et al. (2013) compared infants who died of SIDS with a matched control and found that infants younger than three months old who slept in bed with a parent were five times more likely to die of SIDS compared to babies who slept separately from the parents but were still in the same room. They concluded that bed sharing, even when the parents do not smoke or take alcohol or drugs, increases the risk of SIDS.   
  
However, when combined with parental smoking and maternal alcohol consumption and/or drug use, risks associated with bed sharing greatly increased. The two studies discussed above were based on American statistics. What about the rest of the world?** Co-sleeping** occurs in many cultures, primarily because of a more collectivist perspective that encourages a close parent-child bond and interdependent relationship (Morelli et al., 1992). In countries where co-sleeping is common, however, parents and infants typically sleep on floor mats and other hard surfaces that minimize the suffocation that can occur with bedding (Nelson et al., 2000).

### Reflexes

Newborns are equipped with a number of **reflexes**, which are involuntary movements in response to stimulation. Some of the more common reflexes, such as the sucking reflex and rooting reflex, are important to feeding. The grasping and stepping reflexes are eventually replaced by more voluntary behaviors. Within the first few months of life, these reflexes disappear, while other reflexes, such as the eye-blink, swallowing, sneezing, gagging, and withdrawal reflex, remain as they continue to serve important functions.   
  
Reflexes offer pediatricians insight into the maturation and health of the nervous system. Reflexes that persist longer than they should can impede normal development (Berne, 2006). In preterm infants and those with neurological impairments, some of these reflexes may be absent at birth. Once present, they may persist longer than in a neurologically healthy infant (El-Dib et al., 2012).

Here is a list of the most common reflexes in infants:

- **Sucking: **sucks on anything that touches the lips.
- **Rooting: **turns the head when the cheek is touched.
- **Grasp: **fingers automatically grip anything that touches the palm of the hand.
- **Babinski: **toes fan out when the sole of the foot is stroked from heel to toe.
- **Moro: **a sudden noise or loss of support causes infant to rapidly spread out arms and legs, then quickly contract the limbs inward.
- **Tonic neck: **when lying on back with head to one side, infant extends arm and leg on that side and flexes the limbs on the other side.
- **Stepping: **legs move in stepping motion when feet touch a smooth surface.

### Motor Development
[Opens in new tab](https://assets.wgu.edu/2c7c3a4dde8e0a000a69e293214697a4)"[Baby boy in a carriage on a blue background. A naked child in only diapers is lying in a stroller, studio shot.Opens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.in/detail/photo/baby-boy-in-a-carriage-on-a-blue-background-a-naked-royalty-free-image/1328185491)" by Andrey Zhuravlev, [Getty Images Content License AgreementOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.com/eula#RF)
Motor development occurs in an orderly sequence as infants move from reflexive reactions (such as sucking and rooting) to more advanced motor functioning. As previously mentioned, development occurs according to the cephalocaudal (from head to tail) and proximodistal (from the midline outward) principles. For instance, babies first learn to hold their heads up, then sit with assistance, then sit unassisted, followed later by crawling, pulling up, cruising (walking while holding on to something), and then unassisted walking (Eisenberg et al., 1989).   
  
As motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young children should achieve. For each milestone, there is an average age and a range of ages in which the milestone should be reached. An example of a developmental milestone is a baby holding up its head. Babies, on average, are able to hold up their heads at six weeks old, and 90 percent of babies achieve this between three weeks and four months old.   
  
On average, most babies sit alone at seven months old. Sitting involves both coordination and muscle strength, and 90 percent of babies achieve this milestone between five and nine months old. If the child is displaying delays on several milestones, that is reason for concern, and the parent or caregiver should discuss this with the child's pediatrician. Developmental delays can be identified and addressed through early intervention.

#### Motor Skills

Motor skills refer to the ability to move one's body and manipulate objects. Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in fingers, toes, and eyes and enable coordination of small actions (grasping a toy, writing with a pencil, using a spoon). Newborns cannot grasp objects voluntarily but do wave their arms toward objects of interest.   
  
At about four months of age, the infant is able to reach for an object, first with both arms and, within a few weeks, with only one arm. At this age, grasping an object involves the use of the fingers and palm, but no thumbs. This is known as the **palmar grasp.**  
  
The use of the thumb comes at about nine months of age when the infant is able to grasp an object using the forefinger and thumb. Now the infant uses a **pincer grasp,** and this ability greatly enhances the ability to control and manipulate an object, and infants take great delight in this newfound ability. They may spend hours picking up small objects from the floor and placing them in containers. By nine months, an infant can also watch a moving object, reach for it as it approaches, and grab it.

Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control the head, torso, arms, and legs and involve larger movements (balancing, running, jumping). These skills begin to develop first. Examples include moving to bring the chin up when lying on the stomach, moving the chest up, and rocking back and forth on hands and knees.   
  
But it also includes exploring an object with one's feet as many babies do as early as eight weeks of age if seated in a carrier or other device that frees the hips. This may be easier than reaching for an object with the hands, which requires much more practice (Berk, 2007). Sometimes an infant will try to move toward an object while crawling and to its surprise, move backward because of the greater amount of strength in the arms than in the legs.

### Schema, Assimilation, and Accommodation

#### Schema

Piaget believed that people are continuously trying to maintain cognitive equilibrium, or a balance, in what is seen and known (Piaget, 1954). Children have much more of a challenge in maintaining this balance because they are constantly being confronted with new situations, new words, new objects, etc. All this new information needs to be organized into a framework referred to as a **schema**. 

#### Assimilation

Children develop schemata (the plural for schema) through the processes of assimilation and accommodation. When faced with something new, a child may demonstrate **assimilation**, which is fitting the new information into an existing schema, such as calling all animals with four legs "doggies" because they know the word "doggie."

#### Accommodation

Instead of assimilating the information, the child may demonstrate **accommodation**, which is expanding the framework of knowledge to accommodate the new situation and thus learning a new word to more accurately name the animal. For example, recognizing that a horse is different from a zebra means the child has accommodated, and now the child has both a zebra schema and a horse schema. Even adults continue to try and "make sense" of new situations by determining whether they fit into an old way of thinking (assimilation) or whether they need to modify their thoughts (accommodation).

### Six Substages of the Sensorimotor Stage

According to the Piagetian perspective, infants learn about the world primarily through their senses and motor abilities (Harris, 2005). These basic motor and sensory abilities provide the foundation for the cognitive skills that will emerge during the subsequent stages of cognitive development. The first stage of cognitive development is referred to as the **sensorimotor stage,** and it occurs through six substages.
[Opens in new tab](https://assets.wgu.edu/4586ac8e13c52c8e9a63e5fcc40f9d17)"[Young girl working on a robot design - stock photoOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.in/detail/photo/young-girl-working-on-a-robot-design-royalty-free-image/964701210)" by JGalione, [Getty Images Content License AgreementOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.com/eula#RF)
#### Substages

**Substage 1:****Reflexes.** Newborns learn about their world through the use of their reflexes, such as when sucking, reaching, and grasping. Eventually, the use of these reflexes becomes more deliberate and purposeful.

**Substage 2:****Primary Circular Reactions.** During the next three months, the infant begins to actively involve his or her own body in some form of repeated activity. An infant may accidentally engage in a behavior and find it interesting such as making a vocalization. This interest motivates trying to do it again and helps the infant learn a new behavior that originally occurred by chance. The behavior is identified as circular because of the repetition and as primary because it centers on the infant's own body.

**Substage 3:****Secondary Circular Reactions.** The infant begins to interact with objects in the environment. At first, the infant interacts with objects (such as a crib mobile) accidentally, but then these contacts with the objects are deliberate and become a repeated activity. The infant becomes more and more actively engaged in the outside world and takes delight in being able to make things happen. Repeated motion brings particular interest as, for example, the infant is able to bang two lids from the cupboard together when seated on the kitchen floor.

**Substage 4:****Coordination of Secondary Circular Reactions.** The infant combines these basic reflexes and simple behaviors and uses planning and coordination to achieve a specific goal. Now the infant can engage in behaviors that others perform and anticipate upcoming events. Perhaps because of continued maturation of the prefrontal cortex, the infant becomes capable of having a thought and carrying out a planned, goal-directed activity. For example, an infant sees a toy car under the kitchen table and then crawls, reaches, and grabs the toy. The infant is coordinating both internal and external activities to achieve a planned goal.

**Substage 5:****Tertiary Circular Reactions.** The toddler is considered a "little scientist" and begins exploring the world in a trial-and-error manner, using both motor skills and planning abilities. For example, the child might throw a ball down the stairs to see what happens. Toddlers' active engagement in experimentation helps them learn about their world.

**Substage 6:****Beginning of Representational Thought.** The sensorimotor period ends with the appearance of symbolic or representational thought. The toddler now has a basic understanding that objects can be used as symbols. Additionally, the child is able to solve problems using mental strategies, to remember something heard days before and repeat it, and to engage in pretend play. This initial movement from a hands-on approach to knowing about the world to the more mental world of substage six marks the transition to preoperational thought.

### Development of Object Permanence

A critical milestone during the sensorimotor period is the development of **object permanence**. Object permanence is the understanding that even if something is out of sight, it still exists (Bogartz et al., 2000). According to Piaget, young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight. Piaget studied infants' reactions when a toy was first shown to them and then hidden under a blanket. Infants who had already developed object permanence would reach for the hidden toy, indicating that they knew it still existed, whereas infants who had not developed object permanence would appear confused.   
  
Piaget emphasizes this construct because it was an objective way for children to demonstrate that they can mentally represent their world. Children have typically acquired this milestone by eight months. Once toddlers have mastered object permanence, they enjoy games like hide and seek, and they realize that when someone leaves the room, they will come back. Toddlers also point to pictures in books and look in appropriate places when you ask them to find objects.

#### Stranger Anxiety

In Piaget's view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin to exhibit **stranger anxiety,** which is a fear of unfamiliar people (Crain, 2005). Babies may demonstrate this by crying and turning away from a stranger, clinging to a caregiver, or attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces, such as parents. Stranger anxiety results when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore, she cannot predict what her experience with that stranger will be like, which results in a fear response.

### Critique of Piaget

Piaget thought that children's ability to understand objects, such as learning that a rattle makes a noise when shaken, was a cognitive skill that develops slowly as a child matures and interacts with the environment. Today, developmental psychologists think Piaget was incorrect. Researchers have found that even very young children understand objects and how they work long before they have experience with those objects (Baillargeon, 1987; Baillargeon et al., 2011). For example, Piaget believed that infants did not fully master object permanence until substage 5 of the sensorimotor period (Thomas, 1979). 

However, infants seem to be able to recognize that objects have permanence at much younger ages. Diamond (1985) found that infants show earlier knowledge if the waiting period is shorter. At age six months, they retrieved the hidden object if their wait for retrieving the object is no longer than two seconds, and at seven months if the wait is no longer than four seconds.

Others have found that children as young as three months old have demonstrated knowledge of the properties of objects that they had only viewed and did not have prior experience with. In one study, three-month-old infants were shown a truck rolling down a track and behind a screen. The box, which appeared solid but was actually hollow, was placed next to the track. The truck rolled past the box as would be expected. Then the box was placed on the track to block the path of the truck. When the truck was rolled down the track this time, it continued unimpeded. The infants spent significantly more time looking at this impossible event. Baillargeon (1987) concluded that they knew solid objects cannot pass through each other. Baillargeon's findings suggest that very young children have an understanding of objects and how they work, which Piaget (1954) would have said is beyond their cognitive abilities due to their limited experiences in the world.

### Infant Memory

Memory requires a certain degree of brain maturation, so it should not be surprising that infant memory is rather fleeting and fragile. As a result, older children and adults experience **infantile amnesia**, the inability to recall memories from the first few years of life. Several hypotheses have been proposed for this amnesia. From the biological perspective, it has been suggested that infantile amnesia is due to the immaturity of the infant brain, especially those areas that are crucial to the formation of autobiographical memory, such as the hippocampus.

From the cognitive perspective, it has been suggested that babies' and toddlers' lack of linguistic skills limit their ability to mentally represent events, thereby reducing their ability to encode memory. Moreover, even if infants do form such early memories, older children and adults may not be able to access them because they may be employing very different, more linguistically based, retrieval cues than infants used when forming the memory. Finally, social theorists argue that episodic memories of personal experiences may hinge on an understanding of "self," something that is clearly lacking in infants and young toddlers.

However, in a series of clever studies, Carolyn Rovee-Collier and her colleagues have demonstrated that infants can remember events from their life, even if these memories are short-lived. Three-month-old infants were taught that they could make a mobile hung over their crib shake by kicking their legs. The infants were placed in their cribs on their backs. A ribbon was tied to one foot and the other end to a mobile. At first infants made random movements but then came to realize that by kicking, they could make the mobile shake. After two nine-minute sessions with the mobile, the mobile was removed. One week later, the mobile was reintroduced to one group of infants, and most of the babies immediately started kicking their legs, indicating that they remembered their prior experience with the mobile.

A second group of infants was shown the mobile two weeks later, and the babies made only random movements. The memory had faded (Rovee-Collier, 1987; Giles & Rovee-Collier, 2011). Rovee-Collier and Hayne (1987) found that three-month-olds could remember the mobile after two weeks if they were shown the mobile and watched it move, even though they were not tied to it. This reminder helped most infants remember the connection between their kicking and the movement of the mobile. Like many researchers of infant memory, Rovee-Collier (1990) found infant memory to be very context-dependent. In other words, the sessions with the mobile and the later retrieval sessions had to be conducted under very similar circumstances, or else the babies would not remember their prior experiences with the mobile. For instance, if the first mobile had yellow blocks with blue letters, but at the later retrieval session, the blocks were blue with yellow letters, the babies would not kick.

Infants older than six months of age can retain information for longer periods of time; they also need less reminding to retrieve information in memory. Studies of **deferred imitation** (that is, the imitation of actions after a time delay) can occur as early as six months of age (Campanella & Rovee-Collier, 2005), but only if infants are allowed to practice the behavior they were shown. By 12 months of age, infants no longer need to practice the behavior in order to retain the memory for four weeks (Klein & Meltzoff, 1999).

### Next Step

Now move ahead to the next lesson.

### Lesson 6: Introduction

In early childhood, as in other stages of human growth and development, growth is physical as well as mental. As children develop their motor and sensory skills, they also make tremendous advancements in processing, storing, and using information. In other words, they display a considerable development of their cognitive skills as well.

In this lesson, you will learn about the various phases of cognitive development during early childhood.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in cognitive development during early childhood.

### Language

Humans' vast intelligence allows them to have language, a system of communication that uses symbols in a regular way to create meaning. Language gives people the ability to communicate intelligence to others by talking, reading, and writing. Although other species have at least some ability to communicate, none of them have language. Several components of language will now be discussed.

### Components of Language

#### Phoneme

A **phoneme** is the smallest unit of sound that makes a meaningful difference in a language. For example, the word "bit" has three phonemes. In spoken languages, phonemes are produced by the positions and movements of the vocal tract, including our lips, teeth, tongue, vocal cords, and throat, whereas in sign languages, phonemes are defined by the shapes and movement of the hands.

There are hundreds of unique phonemes that can be made by human speakers, but most languages only use a small subset of the possibilities. For example, English contains about 45 phonemes, whereas some languages have as few as 15 and others more than 60. The Hawaiian language contains fewer phonemes as it includes only five vowels (a, e, i, o, and u) and seven consonants (h, k, l, m, n, p, and w).

Infants are born able to detect all phonemes, but they lose their ability to do so as they get older; by 10 months of age, a child's ability to recognize phonemes becomes very similar to that of the adult speakers of the native language. Phonemes that were initially differentiated come to be treated as equivalent (Werker & Tees, 2002).

#### Morpheme

Whereas phonemes are the smallest units of sound in language, a** morpheme** is a string of one or more phonemes that makes up the smallest units of meaning in a language.

Some morphemes are prefixes and suffixes used to modify other words. For example, the syllable *re-* as in "rewrite" or "repay" means "to do again," and the suffix *-est* as in "happiest" or "coolest" means "to the maximum."

#### Semantics

**Semantics** refers to the set of rules people use to obtain meaning from morphemes. For example, adding *-ed* to the end of a verb makes it past tense.

#### Syntax

**Syntax** is the set of rules of a language by which people construct sentences. Each language has a different syntax. The syntax of the English language requires that each sentence have a noun and a verb, each of which may be modified by adjectives and adverbs. Some syntaxes make use of the order in which words appear. For example, in English, the meaning of the sentence "The man bites the dog" is different from the meaning of "The dog bites the man."

#### Pragmatics

The social side of language is expressed through **pragmatics,** or how people communicate effectively and appropriately with others. Examples of pragmatics include turn-taking, staying on topic, volume and tone of voice, and appropriate eye contact.

Lastly, words do not possess fixed meanings but change their interpretation as a function of the context in which they are spoken. People use** contextual information,** the information surrounding language, to interpret it. Examples of contextual information include knowledge and nonverbal expressions, such as facial expressions, postures, and gestures. Misunderstandings can easily arise if people are not attentive to contextual information or if some of it is missing, such as it may be in newspaper headlines or in text messages.

### Language Development Progression

An important aspect of cognitive development is language acquisition. The order in which children learn language structures is consistent across children and cultures (Hatch, 1983). Starting before birth, babies begin to develop language and communication skills. At birth, babies recognize their mothers' voices, they can discriminate between the language(s) spoken by their mothers and foreign languages, and they show preferences for faces that are moving in synchrony with audible language (Blossom & Morgan, 2006; Pickens et al., 1994; Spelke & Cortelyou, 1981).

#### Newborn Communication

**Do Newborns Communicate?**

Of course, they do. They do not, however, communicate with the use of oral language. Instead, they communicate their thoughts and needs with body posture (being relaxed or still), gestures, cries, and facial expressions. A person who spends adequate time with an infant can learn which cries indicate pain and which ones indicate hunger, discomfort, or frustration.

**Intentional Vocalizations**

In terms of producing spoken language, babies begin to coo almost immediately. **Cooing** is a one-syllable combination of a consonant and a vowel sound ("coo" or "ba"). Interestingly, babies replicate sounds from their own languages. A baby whose parents speak French will coo in a different tone than a baby whose parents speak Spanish or Urdu. These gurgling, musical vocalizations can serve as a source of entertainment to an infant who has been laid down for a nap or seated in a carrier on a car ride. Cooing serves as practice for vocalization, as well as the infant hears the sound of their own voice and tries to repeat sounds that are entertaining. Infants also begin to learn the pace and pause of conversation as they alternate their vocalization with that of someone else and then take their turn again when the other person's vocalization has stopped.

At about four to six months of age, infants begin making even more elaborate vocalizations that include the sounds required for any language. Guttural sounds, clicks, consonants, and vowel sounds stand ready to equip the child with the ability to repeat whatever sounds are characteristic of the language heard. Eventually, these sounds will no longer be used as the infant grows more accustomed to a particular language.

At about seven months, infants begin babbling, engaging in intentional vocalizations that lack specific meaning and comprise a consonant-vowel repeated sequence, such as ma-ma-ma and da-da-da. Children babble as practice in creating specific sounds, and by the time they are one year old, the babbling uses primarily the sounds of the language that they are learning (de Boysson-Bardieset al., 1984). These vocalizations have a conversational tone that sounds meaningful even though it is not. Babbling also helps children understand the social, communicative function of language. Children who are exposed to sign language babble in sign by making hand movements that represent real language (Petitto & Marentette, 1991).

**Gesturing**

Children communicate information through gesturing long before they speak, and there is some evidence that gesture usage predicts subsequent language development (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). Deaf babies also use gestures to communicate wants, reactions, and feelings. Because gesturing seems to be easier than vocalization for some toddlers, sign language is sometimes taught to enhance one's ability to communicate by making use of the ease of gesturing. The rhythm and pattern of language are used when deaf babies sign, just as it is when hearing babies babble.

**Understanding**

At around 10 months of age, infants can understand more than they can say, which is referred to as receptive language. You may have experienced this phenomenon as well if you have ever tried to learn a second language. You may have been able to follow a conversation more easily than contribute to it. Among the first words that children understand are their own names, usually by about six months, followed by commonly used words like "bottle," "mama," and "doggie" by 10–12 months (Mandel et al., 1995).

Infants shake their heads "no" around six to nine months, and they respond to verbal requests to do things like "wave bye-bye" or "blow a kiss" around 9 to 12 months. Children also use contextual information, particularly the cues that parents provide, to help them learn language. Children learn that people are usually referring to things that they are looking at when they are speaking (Baldwin, 1993) and that the speaker's emotional expressions are related to the content of their speech.

**Holophrasic Speech**

Children begin using their first words at about 12 or 13 months of age and may use partial words to convey thoughts at even younger ages. These one-word expressions are referred to as** holophrasic speech.** For example, the child may say "ju" for the word "juice" and use this sound when referring to a bottle. The listener must interpret the meaning of the holophrase, and when this is someone who has spent time with the child, interpretation is not too difficult. But, someone who has not been around the child will have trouble knowing what is meant. Imagine the parent who to a friend exclaims, "Ezra's talking all the time now!" The friend hears only "ju da ga" to which the parent explains means, "I want some milk when I go with Daddy."

**Language Errors**

The early utterances of children contain many errors, for instance, confusing /b/ and /d/, or /c/ and /z/. The words children create are often simplified, in part because they are not yet able to make the more complex sounds of the real language (Dobrich & Scarborough, 1992). For example, children may say "keekee" for kitty, "nana" for banana, and "vesketti" for spaghetti because it is easier. Often these early words are accompanied by gestures that may also be easier to produce than the words themselves. Children's pronunciations become increasingly accurate between one and three years, but some problems may persist until school age.

A child who learns that a word stands for an object may initially think that the word can be used for only that particular object, which is referred to as underextension. Only the family's Irish Setter is a "doggie," for example. More often, however, a child may think that a label applies to all objects that are similar to the original object, which is called overextension. For example, all animals become "doggies." The first error is often the result of children learning the meaning of a word in a specific context, while the second language error is a function of the child's smaller vocabulary.  
  

**Two-Word Sentences and Telegraphic Speech**

By the time they become toddlers, children have a vocabulary of about 50-200 words and begin putting those words together in telegraphic speech, such as “baby bye-bye” or “doggie pretty.” Words needed to convey messages are used, but the articles and other parts of speech necessary for grammatical correctness are not yet used. These expressions sound like a telegraph, or perhaps a better analogy today would be that they read like a text message. Telegraphic speech or text message speech occurs when unnecessary words are not used. “Give baby ball” is used rather than “Give the baby the ball.”

**Infant-Directed Speech**

Why is a horse a “horsie”? Have you ever wondered why adults tend to use “baby talk” or that sing-song type of intonation and exaggeration used when talking to children? This represents a universal tendency and is known as infant-directed speech. It involves exaggerating the vowel and consonant sounds, using a high-pitched voice, and delivering the phrase with great facial expression (Clark, 2009). Why is this done? Infants are frequently more attuned to the tone of voice of the person speaking than to the content of the words themselves and are aware of the target of speech. Werker, Pegg, and McLeod (1994) found that infants listened longer to a woman who was speaking to a baby than to a woman who was speaking to another adult. Adults may use this form of speech in order to clearly articulate the sounds of a word so that the child can hear the sounds involved. It may also be because when this type of speech is used, the infant pays more attention to the speaker and this sets up a pattern of interaction in which the speaker and listener are in tune with one another.

### Brain Maturation

#### Brain Weight

The brain is about 75 percent of its adult weight by three years of age. By age six, it is at 95 percent of its adult weight (Lenroot & Giedd, 2006). Myelination and the development of dendrites continue to occur in the cortex, and as it does, there is a corresponding change in what the child is capable of doing. Greater development in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain behind the forehead that helps people think, strategize, and control attention and emotion, makes it increasingly possible to inhibit emotional outbursts and understand how to play games. Understanding the game, thinking ahead, and coordinating movement improve with practice and myelination.

#### Growth in the Hemispheres and Corpus Callosum

Between ages three and six, the left hemisphere of the brain grows dramatically. This side of the brain or hemisphere is typically involved in language skills. The right hemisphere continues to grow throughout early childhood and is involved in tasks that require **spatial skills**, such as recognizing shapes and patterns. The **corpus callosum**, a dense band of fibers that connects the two hemispheres of the brain, contains approximately 200 million nerve fibers that connect the hemispheres (Kolb & Whishaw, 2011). 

The corpus callosum is located a couple of inches below the longitudinal fissure, which runs the length of the brain and separates the two cerebral hemispheres (Garrett, 2015). Because the two hemispheres carry out different functions, they communicate with each other and integrate their activities through the corpus callosum. Additionally, because incoming information is directed toward one hemisphere, such as visual information from the left eye being directed to the right hemisphere, the corpus callosum shares this information with the other hemisphere.

The corpus callosum undergoes a growth spurt between ages three and six, and this results in improved coordination between right and left hemisphere tasks. For example, in comparison to other individuals, children younger than six demonstrate difficulty coordinating an Etch-A-Sketch toy because their corpus callosum is not developed enough to integrate the movements of both hands (Kalat, 2016).

### Motor Skill Development

Early childhood is the time period when most children acquire the basic skills for **locomotion**, such as running, jumping, and skipping, and **object control skills**, such as throwing, catching, and kicking (Clark, 1994). Children continue to improve their gross motor skills as they run and jump. Fine motor skills are also being refined in activities, such as pouring water into a container, drawing, coloring, buttoning coats, and using scissors.   
  
The development of greater coordination of muscles groups and finer precision can be seen during this time period. Thus, average two-year-olds may be able to run with slightly better coordination than they managed as a toddler, yet they would have difficulty peddling a tricycle, something the typical three-year-old can do. There are similar changes in fine motor skills with four-year-olds who no longer struggle to put on their clothes, something they may have had problems with two years earlier. Motor skills continue to develop into middle childhood, but play that deliberately involves these skills is emphasized for those in early childhood.

### Children's Art

Children's art highlights many developmental changes. Kellogg (1969) noted that children's drawings underwent several transformations. Starting with about 20 different types of scribbles at age two, children move on to experimenting with the placement of scribbles on the page. By age three, they are using the basic structure of scribbles to create shapes and are beginning to combine these shapes to create more complex images. By four or five, children are creating images that are more recognizable representations of the world. These changes are a function of improvement in motor skills, perceptual development, and cognitive understanding of the world (Coté & Golbeck, 2007).  
  
The drawing of "tadpoles" is a pervasive feature of young children's drawings of self and others. Tadpoles emerge in children's drawings at about the age of three and have been observed in the drawings of young children around the world (Gernhardt et al., 2015), but there are cultural variations in the size, number of facial features, and emotional expressions displayed. Gernhardt et al. (2015) found that children from Western contexts (such as urban areas of Germany and Sweden) and urban, educated non-Western contexts (such as urban areas of Turkey, Costa Rica, and Estonia) drew larger images with more facial detail and more positive emotional expressions.   
  
Those from non-Western rural contexts (such as rural areas of Cameroon and India) depicted themselves as smaller, with fewer facial details and a more neutral emotional expression. The authors suggest that cultural norms of non-Western traditionally rural cultures, which emphasize the social group rather than the individual, may be one of the factors for the smaller size of the figures compared to the larger figures from children in the Western cultures that emphasize the individual.

### Piaget's Preoperational Stage

Piaget's stage that coincides with early childhood is the **preoperational stage.** According to Piaget, this stage occurs from the age of two to seven years. In the preoperational stage, children use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is why children in this stage engage in pretend play. A child's arms might become airplane wings as she zooms around the room, or a child with a stick might become a brave knight with a sword.   
  
Children also begin to use language in the preoperational stage, but they cannot understand adult logic or mentally manipulate information. The term **operational** refers to logical manipulation of information, so children at this stage are considered preoperational. Children's logic is based on their own personal knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventional knowledge.

The preoperational period is divided into two stages: The **symbolic function substage** occurs between two and four years of age and is characterized by the child being able to mentally represent an object that is not present and a dependence on perception in problem solving. The **intuitive thought substage,** lasting from four to seven years, is marked by greater dependence on intuitive thinking rather than just perception (Thomas, 1979).   
  
This implies that children think automatically without using evidence. At this stage, children ask many questions as they attempt to understand the world around them using immature reasoning. Let us examine some of Piaget's assertions about children's cognitive abilities at this age. 

### Children’s Cognitive Abilities

#### Pretend Play

Pretending is a favorite activity at this time. A toy has qualities beyond the way it was designed to function and can now be used to stand for a character or object unlike anything originally intended. A teddy bear, for example, can be a baby or the queen of a faraway land. Piaget believed that children's pretend play helped children solidify new schemata they were developing cognitively. This play, then, reflected changes in their conceptions or thoughts. However, children also learn as they pretend and experiment. Their play does not simply represent what they have learned (Berk, 2007).

#### Egocentrism

**Egocentrism** in early childhood refers to the tendency of young children not to be able to take the perspective of others, and instead, the child thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just as they do. Egocentric children are not able to infer the perspective of other people and instead attribute their own perspective to situations. For example, 10-year-old Keiko's birthday is coming up, so her mom takes 3-year-old Kenny to the toy store to choose a present for his sister. He selects an Iron Man action figure for her, thinking that if he likes the toy, his sister will too.

Piaget's classic experiment on egocentrism involved showing children a three-dimensional model of a mountain and asking them to describe what a doll that is looking at the mountain from a different angle might see. Children tend to choose a picture that represents their own rather than the doll's view. By age seven, children are less self-centered. However, even younger children, when speaking to others, tend to use different sentence structures and vocabulary when addressing a younger child or an older adult. This indicates some awareness of the views of others.

#### Conservation Errors

**Conservation** refers to the ability to recognize that moving or rearranging matter does not change the quantity. For example, Kenny and Keiko's dad gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and another slice to 3-year-old Kenny. Kenny's pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than she did. Kenny did not understand that cutting the pizza into smaller pieces did not increase the overall amount. This was because Kenny exhibited centration by focusing on only one characteristic of an object to the exclusion of others. Kenny focused on the five pieces of pizza to his sister's one piece even though the total amount was the same. Keiko was able to consider several characteristics of an object rather than just one. Because children have not developed this understanding of conservation, they cannot perform mental operations.

The classic Piagetian experiment associated with conservation involves liquid (Crain, 2005). In this experiment, a child is shown two glasses that are filled to the same level and asked if they have the same amount. Usually, the child agrees they have the same amount. The experimenter then pours the liquid in one glass to a taller and thinner glass. The child is again asked if the two glasses have the same amount of liquid. The preoperational child will typically say the taller glass now has more liquid because it is taller. The child has concentrated on the height of the glass and fails to conserve.

#### Classification Errors

Preoperational children have difficulty understanding that an object can be classified in more than one way. For example, if shown three white buttons and four black buttons and asked whether there are more black buttons or buttons, the child is likely to respond that there are more black buttons. They do not consider the general class of buttons. Because young children lack these general classes, their reasoning is typically **transductive,** that is, making faulty inferences from one specific example to another.   
  
For example, Piaget's daughter Lucienne stated she had not had her nap; therefore, it was not afternoon. She did not understand that afternoons are a time period, and her nap was just one of many events that occurred in the afternoon (Crain, 2005). As the child's vocabulary improves and more schemata are developed, the ability to classify objects improves.

#### Animism 

**Animism **refers to attributing lifelike qualities to objects. The cup is alive, the chair that falls down and hits the child's ankle is mean, and the toys need to stay home because they are tired. Cartoons frequently show objects that appear alive and take on lifelike qualities. Young children do seem to think that objects that move may be alive, but after age three, they seldom refer to objects as being alive (Berk, 2007).

#### Critique of Piaget

Similar to the critique of the sensorimotor period, several psychologists have attempted to show that Piaget also underestimated preoperational children's intellectual capabilities. For example, children's specific experiences can influence when they are able to conserve. Children of pottery makers in Mexican villages know that reshaping clay does not change the amount of clay at much younger ages than children who do not have similar experiences (Price-Williams et al., 1969).   
  
Crain (2005) indicates that preoperational children can think rationally on mathematical and scientific tasks, and they are not as egocentric as Piaget implied. Research on the Theory of Mind has demonstrated that children overcome egocentrism by four or five years of age, which is sooner than Piaget indicated.

### Piaget's Preoperational Stage

Piaget's stage that coincides with early childhood is the **preoperational stage.** According to Piaget, this stage occurs from the age of two to seven years. In the preoperational stage, children use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is why children in this stage engage in pretend play.

### Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory of Cognitive Development

Lev Vygotsky (1896–1934) was a Russian psychologist who argued that culture has a major impact on a child's cognitive development. Piaget and Gesell believed development stemmed directly from the child, and although Vygotsky acknowledged intrinsic development, he argued that it is the language, writings, and concepts arising from the culture that elicit the highest level of cognitive thinking (Crain, 2005).   
  
He believed that social interactions with adults and more learned peers can facilitate a child's potential for learning. Without this interpersonal instruction, he believed children's minds would not advance very far as their knowledge would be based only on their own discoveries. Some of Vygotsky's key concepts are described below.

#### Zone of Proximal Development and Scaffolding

Vygotsky's best-known concept is the **zone of proximal development (ZPD)**. Vygotsky stated that children should be taught in the ZPD, which occurs when they can almost perform a task but not quite on their own without assistance. With the right kind of teaching, however, they can accomplish it successfully. A good teacher identifies a child's ZPD and helps the child stretch beyond it. Then the adult (teacher) gradually withdraws support until the child can then perform the task unaided.   
  
Researchers have applied the metaphor of scaffolds (the temporary platforms on which construction workers stand) to this way of teaching. **Scaffolding** is the temporary support that parents or teachers give a child to do a task.

#### Private Speech

Do you ever talk to yourself? Why? Chances are, this occurs when you are struggling with a problem, trying to remember something, or feeling very emotional about a situation. Children talk to themselves too. Piaget interpreted this as egocentric speech or speech that is focused on the child and does not include another's point of view.

Vygotsky, however, believed that children talk to themselves in order to solve problems or clarify thoughts. As children learn to think in words, they do so aloud before eventually closing their lips and engaging in private speech or inner speech. 

Thinking out loud eventually becomes thought accompanied by internal speech, and talking to oneself becomes a practice only engaged in when we are trying to learn something or remember something. This inner speech is not as elaborate as the speech we use when communicating with others (Vygotsky, 1962).

#### Contrast with Piaget

Piaget was highly critical of teacher-directed instruction, believing that teachers who take control of the child's learning place the child into a passive role (Crain, 2005). Further, teachers may present abstract ideas without the child's true understanding, and instead, they just repeat back what they heard. Piaget believed children must be given opportunities to discover concepts on their own.   
  
As previously stated, Vygotsky did not believe children could reach a higher cognitive level without instruction from more learned individuals. Who is correct? Both theories certainly contribute to our understanding of how children learn.

### Information Processing

Information processing researchers have focused on several issues in cognitive development for this age group, including improvements in attention skills and changes in the capacity and emergence of executive functions in working memory. Additionally, in early childhood, memory strategies, memory accuracy, and autobiographical memory emerge. Early childhood is seen by many researchers as a crucial time period in memory development (Posner & Rothbart, 2007).

### Attention

Changes in attention have been described by many as the key to changes in human memory (Nelson & Fivush, 2004; Posner & Rothbart, 2007). However, attention is not a unified function; it is comprised of subprocesses. The ability to switch focus between tasks or external stimuli is called **divided attention** or multitasking. This is separate from the ability to focus on a single task or stimulus while ignoring distracting information, called selective attention.   
  
Different from these is **sustained attention,** or the ability to stay on task for long periods of time. Moreover, people also have attention processes that influence behavior and enable them to inhibit a habitual or dominant response, as well as others that enable them to distract themselves when upset or frustrated.

#### Divided Attention

Young children (ages three to four) have considerable difficulties in dividing their attention between two tasks and often perform at levels equivalent to humans' closest relative, the chimpanzee, but by age five, they have surpassed the chimp (Hermann et al., 2015; Hermann & Tomasello, 2015). Despite these improvements, five-year-olds continue to perform below the level of school-age children, adolescents, and adults.

#### Selective Attention

Children's ability with **selective attention** tasks improve as they age. However, this ability is also greatly influenced by the child's temperament (Rothbart & Rueda, 2005), the complexity of the stimulus or task (Porporino et al., 2004), and along with whether the stimuli are visual or auditory (Guy et al., 2013). Guy et al. (2013) found that children's ability to selectively attend to visual information outpaced that of auditory stimuli.   
  
This may explain why young children are not able to hear the voice of the teacher over the cacophony of sounds in the typical preschool classroom (Jones et al., 2015). Jones and his colleagues found that 4- to 7-year-olds could not filter out background noise, especially when its frequencies were close in sound to the target sound. In comparison, 8- to 11-year-old children often performed similarly to adults.

#### Sustained Attention

Most measures of sustained attention typically ask children to spend several minutes focusing on one task while waiting for an infrequent event while there are multiple distractors for several minutes. Berwid et al. (2005) asked children between the ages of three and seven to push a button whenever a "target" image was displayed, but they had to refrain from pushing the button when a non-target image was shown. The younger the child, the more difficulty with maintaining attention.

### Memory

#### Sensory Memory

Based on studies of adults, people with amnesia, and neurological research on memory, researchers have proposed several "types'' of memory. **Sensory memory** is the first stage of the memory system, and it stores sensory input in its raw form for a very brief duration, essentially long enough for the brain to register and start processing the information. Studies of auditory sensory memory have found that the sensory memory trace for the characteristics of a tone lasts about one second in two-year-olds, two seconds in three-year-olds, more than two seconds in four-year-olds, and three to five seconds in six-year-olds (Glass et al., 2008).   
  
Other researchers have found that young children hold sounds for a shorter duration than do older children and adults and that this deficit is not due to attentional differences between these age groups but reflects differences in the performance of the sensory memory system (Gomes et al., 1999).

Environmental input in the form of sensory input (sights, sounds, etc.) enter Sensory Memory, where it may either move to Short-Term Memory via attention or be forgotten. In Short-Term Memory, input must be maintained, or it will be forgotten through decay or displacement. Elaborate rehearsal moves input to Long-Term Memory, where it is either retrieved from time to time or forgotten through interference or retrieval failure."[Information Processing Model - Atkinson & ShiffrinOpens in new tab](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Information_Processing_Model_-_Atkinson_%26_Shiffrin.jpg)" by Dkahng, [Wikimedia CommonsOpens in new tab](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is licensed under, [CC-BY-SA 4.0Opens in new tab](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en)/modified for higher resolution purposes from original by WGU
#### Working Memory

The second stage of the memory system is called short-term or **working memory.** Working memory is the component of memory in which current conscious mental activity occurs.

Working memory often requires conscious effort and adequate use of attention to function effectively. As you read earlier, children in this age group struggle with many aspects of attention, and this greatly diminishes their ability to consciously juggle several pieces of information in memory. The capacity of working memory, that is, the amount of information someone can hold in consciousness, is smaller in young children than in older children and adults (Galotti, 2018).   
  
The typical adult and teenager can hold a seven-digit number active in their short-term memory. The typical five-year-old can hold only a four-digit number active. This means that the more complex a mental task is, the less efficient a younger child will be in paying attention to and actively process information in order to complete the task.

**Executive Function**

Changes in attention and the working memory system also involve changes in executive function. **Executive function** refers to self-regulatory processes, such as the ability to inhibit a behavior or cognitive flexibility, that enable adaptive responses to new situations or to reach a specific goal. Executive function skills gradually emerge during early childhood and continue to develop throughout childhood and adolescence.   
  
Like many cognitive changes, brain maturation, especially the prefrontal cortex, along with experience influence the development of executive function skills. Children show higher executive function skills when parents are warm and responsive, use scaffolding when the child is trying to solve a problem, and provide cognitively stimulating environments (Fay-Stammbach et al., 2014). For instance, scaffolding was positively correlated with greater cognitive flexibility at age two and inhibitory control at age four (Bibok et al., 2009).

**Memory Performance**

Older children and adults use mental strategies to aid their memory performance. For instance, simple rote rehearsal may be used to commit information to memory. Young children often do not rehearse unless reminded to do so, and when they do rehearse, they often fail to use clustering rehearsal. In **clustering rehearsal,** the person rehearses previous material while adding in additional information.   
  
If a list of words is read out loud to you, you are likely to rehearse each word as you hear it along with any previous words you were given. Young children will repeat each word they hear but often fail to repeat the prior words in the list. In Schneider et al.'s (2009) longitudinal study of 102 kindergarten children, the majority of children used no strategy to remember information, a finding that was consistent with previous research. As a result, their memory performance was poor when compared to their abilities as they aged and started to use more effective memory strategies.

#### Long-Term Memory

The third component in memory is** long-term memory**, which is also known as permanent memory. A basic division of long-term memory is between declarative and non-declarative memory. **Declarative memories** are memories for facts or events that we can consciously recollect. **Non-declarative memories**, sometimes referred to as implicit memories, are typically automated skills that do not require conscious recollection.   
  
Remembering that you have an exam next week would be an example of a declarative memory. In contrast, knowing how to walk, so you can get to the classroom or how to hold a pencil to write would be examples of non-declarative memories. Declarative memory is further divided into semantic and episodic memory. **Semantic memories** are memories for facts and knowledge that are not tied to a timeline, while **episodic memories** are tied to specific events in time.

**Autobiographical Memory**

A component of episodic memory is **autobiographical memory,** or personal narrative. Recall the concept of infantile amnesia. Adults rarely remember events from the first few years of life; they lack autobiographical memories from experiences as an infant, toddler, and very young preschooler. Several factors contribute to the emergence of autobiographical memory, including brain maturation, improvements in language, opportunities to talk about experiences with parents and others, the development of theory of mind, and a representation of "self" (Nelson & Fivush, 2004).   
  
Two-year-olds do remember fragments of personal experiences, but these are rarely coherent accounts of past events (Nelson & Ross, 1980). Between two and two-and-a-half years of age, children can provide more information about past experiences. However, these recollections require considerable prodding by adults (Nelson & Fivush, 2004). Over the next few years, children will form more detailed autobiographical memories and engage in more reflection of the past.

### Next Step

Now move ahead to the next lesson.

### Lesson 7:  Introduction

Behavioral genetics is the study of the interplay between the genetic and environmental contributions to behavior.  This bidirectional interplay suggests that the environment can affect the expression of genes.

In this lesson, you will explore the concept of behavioral genetics, temperament, and infant emotions. You will also learn about the concept of attachment and Erikson's theory of psychosocial development. Attachment is the bond between caregiver and infant from which the infant derives a sense of security.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in psychosocial development during the newborn period.

### Behavioral Genetics

**Behavioral genetics** is the scientific study of the interplay between the genetic and environmental contributions to behavior, often referred to as the nature/nurture debate. Gottlieb (1998, 2000, 2002) suggests an analytic framework for this debate that recognizes the interplay between the environment, behavior, and genetic expression. This bidirectional interplay suggests that the environment can affect the expression of genes just as genetic predispositions can impact a person's potential. Additionally, environmental circumstances can trigger symptoms of a genetic disorder.

For example, a person who has sickle cell anemia, a recessive gene-linked disorder, can experience a sickle cell crisis under conditions of oxygen deprivation. Someone predisposed genetically for Type 2 diabetes can trigger the disease through poor diet and little exercise.

Research has shown how the environment and genotype interact in several ways. **Genotype-environment correlations** refer to the processes by which genetic factors contribute to variations in the environment (Plomin et al., 2013). There are three types of genotype-environment correlations:

1. **Passive genotype-environment correlation** occurs when children passively inherit the genes and the environments their family provides. Certain behavioral characteristics, such as being athletically inclined, may run in families. The children have inherited both the genes that would enable success at these activities, and given the environmental encouragement to engage in these actions. Consider the Manning family's involvement in football; father, Archie, and sons, Peyton and Eli, were all highly successful quarterbacks in college and the National Football League.
2. **Evocative genotype-environment correlation** refers to how the social environment reacts to individuals based on their inherited characteristics. For example, whether one has a more outgoing or shy temperament will affect how he or she is treated by others.
3. **Active genotype-environment correlation** occurs when individuals seek out environments that support their genetic tendencies. This is also referred to as niche picking. For example, children who are musically inclined seek out music instruction and opportunities that facilitate their natural musical ability.

### Genotype-Environment Interactions

**Genotype-environment interactions** involve genetic susceptibility to the environment. Adoption studies provide evidence for genotype-environment interactions. For example, the Early Growth and Development Study (Leve et al., 2010) followed 360 adopted children and their adopted and biological parents in a longitudinal study. Results have shown that children whose biological parents exhibited psychopathology exhibited significantly fewer behavior problems when their adoptive parents used more structured rather than unstructured parenting.

Additionally, elevated psychopathology in adoptive parents increased the risk for the children's development of behavior problems, but only when the biological parents' psychopathology was high. Consequently, the results show how environmental effects on behavior differ based on the genotype, especially stressful environments on genetically at-risk children.

### Epigenetics

**Epigenetics** studies modifications in DNA that affect gene expression and are passed on when the cells divide. Environmental factors such as nutrition, stress, and teratogens are thought to change gene expression by switching genes on and off. These gene changes can then be inherited by daughter cells. This would explain why identical twins may increasingly differ in gene expression with age.

For example, Fraga et al. (2005) found that when examining differences in DNA using a group of identical twins, they were indistinguishable during the early years. However, when the twins were older there were significant discrepancies in their gene expression, most likely due to different experiences. These differences included susceptibilities to disease and a range of personal characteristics.

### The Human Genome Project

In 1990 the Human Genome Project (HGP), an international scientific endeavor, began the task of sequencing the three billion base pairs that make up the human genome. In April of 2003, more than two years ahead of schedule, scientists completed the genetic blueprint for building a human. Since then, using the information from the HGP, researchers have discovered the genes involved in over 1,800 diseases.

In 2005, the HGP amassed a large database called HapMap that catalogs the genetic variations in 11 global populations. Data on genetic variation can improve people's understanding of differential risk for disease and reactions to medical treatments such as drugs. Pharmacogenomic researchers have already developed tests to determine whether a patient will respond favorably to certain drugs used in the treatment of breast cancer, lung cancer, or HIV by using information from HapMap (NIH, 2015).

Future directions for the HGP include identifying the genetic markers for all 50 major forms of cancer, continued use of the HapMap for creating more effective drugs for the treatment of disease, and examining the legal, social, and ethical implications of genetic knowledge (NIH, 2015).

From the outset, the HGP made ethical issues one of their main concerns. Part of the HGP's budget supports research and holds workshops that address these concerns. Who owns this information? How may the availability of genetic information influence healthcare and its impact on individuals, their families, and the greater community? These are just two of the many questions being addressed (NIH, 2015).

### Temperament

Perhaps you have spent time with a number of infants. How were they alike? How did they differ? How do you compare with your siblings or other children you have known well? You may have noticed that some seemed to be in a better mood than others and that some were more sensitive to noise or more easily distracted than others. These differences may be attributed to temperament. **Temperament** refers to the innate characteristics of the infant, including mood, activity level, and emotional reactivity, noticeable soon after birth. 
[Opens in new tab](https://assets.wgu.edu/1ab55160a164a52b0367de592f0e98e4)"[sad boy on blue blanket backgroundOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.in/detail/photo/sad-boy-on-blue-blanket-background-royalty-free-image/876068274)" by LeManna, [Getty Images Content License AgreementOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.com/eula#RF)
In a 1956 landmark study, Chess and Thomas (1996) evaluated 141 children's temperament based on parental interviews. Referred to as the New York Longitudinal Study, infants were assessed on nine dimensions of temperament, including activity level, rhythmicity (regularity of biological functions), approach/withdrawal (how children deal with new things), adaptability to situations, intensity of reactions, threshold of responsiveness (how intense a stimulus has to be for the child to react), quality of mood, distractibility, attention span, and persistence. Based on the infants' behavioral profiles, they were categorized into three general types of temperament:

• Easy Child (40 percent) who is able to quickly adapt to routine and new situations, remains calm, is easy to soothe, and usually is in a positive mood.

• Difficult Child (10 percent) who reacts negatively to new situations, has trouble adapting to routine, is usually negative in mood, and cries frequently.

• Slow-to-Warm-Up Child (15 percent) has a low activity level, adjusts slowly to new situations, and is often negative in mood.

Notice that the percentages do not equal 100 percent, as some children were not able to be placed neatly into one of the categories. Think about how you might approach each type of child in order to improve your interactions with them. An easy child will not need much extra attention, while a slow-to-warm-up child may need to be given advance warning if new people or situations are going to be introduced. A difficult child may need to be given extra time to burn off their energy.

A caregiver's ability to work well and accurately read the child will enjoy a **goodness-of-fit**, meaning their styles match and communication and interaction can flow. Parents who recognize each child's temperament and accept it will nurture more effective interactions with the child and encourage more adaptive functioning. For example, an adventurous child whose parents regularly take her outside on hikes would provide a good "fit" to her temperament. 

### Bidirectional Parenting

Not only do parents affect their children; children influence their parents. Child characteristics, such as temperament, affect parenting behaviors and roles. For example, an infant with an easy temperament may enable parents to feel more effective, as they are easily able to soothe the child and elicit smiling and cooing. On the other hand, a cranky or fussy infant elicits fewer positive reactions from his or her parents and may result in parents feeling less effective in the parenting role (Eisenberg et al., 2008).   
  
Over time, parents of more difficult children may become more punitive and less patient with their children (Clark et al., 2000; Eisenberg et al., 1999; Kiff et al., 2011). Parents who have a fussy, difficult child are less satisfied with their marriages and have greater challenges in balancing work and family roles (Hyde et al., 2004). Thus, child temperament is one of the child characteristics that influences how parents behave with their children.

Temperament does not change dramatically as people grow up, but they may learn how to work around and manage their temperamental qualities. Temperament may be one of the things about humans that stays the same throughout development. In contrast, **personality,** defined as an individual's consistent pattern of feeling, thinking, and behaving, is the result of the continuous interplay between biological disposition and experience.

Personality also develops from temperament in other ways (Thompson et al., 2010). As children mature biologically, temperamental characteristics emerge and change over time. A newborn is not capable of much self-control, but as brain-based capacities for self-control advance, temperamental changes in self-regulation become more apparent. For example, a newborn who cries frequently does not necessarily have a grumpy personality; over time, with sufficient parental support and increased sense of security, the child might be less likely to cry.

In addition, personality is made up of many other features besides temperament. Children's developing self-concept, their motivations to achieve or to socialize, their values and goals, their coping styles, their sense of responsibility and conscientiousness, and many other qualities are encompassed into personality. These qualities are influenced by biological dispositions, but even more by the child's experiences with others, particularly in close relationships, that guide the growth of individual characteristics. Indeed, personality development begins with the biological foundations of temperament but becomes increasingly elaborated, extended, and refined over time. The newborn that parents gazed upon becomes an adult with a personality of depth and nuance.

### Infant Emotions

At birth, infants exhibit two emotional responses: attraction and withdrawal. They show attraction to pleasant situations that bring comfort, stimulation, and pleasure, and they withdraw from unpleasant stimulation such as bitter flavors or physical discomfort. At around two months, infants exhibit social engagement in the form of social smiling as they respond with smiles to those who engage their positive attention (Lavelli & Fogel, 2005).

Social smiling becomes more stable and organized as infants learn to use their smiles to engage their parents in interactions. Pleasure is expressed as laughter at three to five months of age, and displeasure becomes more specific as fear, sadness, or anger between ages six and eight months. Anger is often the reaction to being prevented from obtaining a goal, such as a toy being removed (Braungart-Rieker et al., 2010).   
  
In contrast, sadness is typically the response when infants are deprived of a caregiver (Papousek, 2007). Fear is often associated with the presence of a stranger, known as stranger wariness, or the departure of significant others known as separation anxiety. Both appear sometime between 6 and 15 months after object permanence has been acquired. Further, there is some indication that infants may experience jealousy as young as 6 months of age (Hart & Carrington, 2002).

#### Facial Expressions

Facial expressions of emotion are important regulators of social interaction. In the developmental literature, this has been investigated under the concept of **social referencing;** that is, the process whereby infants seek out information from others to clarify a situation and then use that information to act (Klinnert et al., 1983). To date, the strongest demonstration of social referencing comes from work on the visual cliff.  
  
In the first study to investigate this concept, Sorce et al. (1985) placed mothers on the far end of the "cliff" from the infant. Mothers first smiled to the infants and placed a toy on top of the safety glass to attract them; infants invariably began crawling to their mothers. When the infants were in the center of the table, however, the mother then posed an expression of fear, sadness, anger, interest, or joy. The results were clearly different for the different faces; no infant crossed the table when the mother showed fear; only 6 percent did when the mother posed anger, 33 percent crossed when the mother posed sadness, and approximately 75 percent of the infants crossed when the mother posed joy or interest.

Other studies provide similar support for facial expressions as regulators of social interaction. Experimenters posed facial expressions of neutral, anger, or disgust toward babies as they moved toward an object and measured the amount of inhibition the babies showed in touching the object (Bradshaw, 1986). The results for 10- and 15-month-olds were the same: Anger produced the greatest inhibition, followed by disgust, with neutral the least.   
  
This study was later replicated using joy and disgust expressions, altering the method so that the infants were not allowed to touch the toy (compared with a distractor object) until one hour after exposure to the expression (Hertenstein & Campos, 2004). At 14 months of age, significantly more infants touched the toy when they saw joyful expressions, but fewer touched the toy when the infants saw disgust.

#### Emotional Self-Regulation

A final emotional change is in self-regulation. **Emotional self-regulation **refers to strategies we use to control our emotional states so that we can attain goals (Thompson & Goodvin, 2007). This requires effortful control of emotions and initially requires assistance from caregivers (Rothbart et al., 2006). Young infants have very limited capacity to adjust their emotional states and depend on their caregivers to help soothe themselves. Caregivers can offer distractions to redirect the infant's attention and comfort to reduce the emotional distress.  
  
As areas of the infant's prefrontal cortex continue to develop, infants can tolerate more stimulation. By four to six months, babies can begin to shift their attention away from upsetting stimuli (Rothbart et al., 2006). Older infants and toddlers can more effectively communicate their need for help and can crawl or walk toward or away from various situations (Cole et al., 2010). This aids in their ability to self-regulate. Temperament also plays a role in children's ability to control their emotional states, and individual differences have been noted in the emotional self-regulation of infants and toddlers (Rothbart & Bates, 2006).

### Self-Awareness

During the second year of life, children begin to recognize themselves as they gain a sense of self as object. In a classic experiment by Lewis and Brooks (1978) children 9 to 24 months of age were placed in front of a mirror after a spot of rouge was placed on their noses; each mother pretended to wipe something off the child's face. If the child reacted by touching his or her own nose rather that of the "baby" in the mirror, it was taken to suggest that the child recognized the reflection as themselves.

Lewis and Brooks found that somewhere between 15 and 24 months most infants developed a sense of self-awareness. **Self-awareness** is the realization that you are separate from others (Kopp, 2011). Once a child has achieved self-awareness, the child is moving toward understanding social emotions such as guilt, shame, or embarrassment, as well as sympathy or empathy.

### Attachments

**Attachment** is the close bond with a caregiver from which the infant derives a sense of security. The formation of attachments in infancy has been the subject of considerable research as attachments have been viewed as foundations for future relationships. Additionally, attachments form the basis for confidence and curiosity as toddlers, and as important influences on self-concept.

### Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory

According to Freud (1938), infants are oral creatures who obtain pleasure from sucking and mouthing objects. Freud believed the infant becomes attached to a person or object that provides this pleasure. Consequently, infants were believed to become attached to their mother because she was the one who satisfied their oral needs and provided pleasure. Freud further believed that the infants will become attached to their mothers "if the mother is relaxed and generous in her feeding practices, thereby allowing the child a lot of oral pleasure" (Shaffer, 1985, p. 435). Was Freud correct in his explanation for why infants became attached?

### Harlow's Research

In one classic study showing if nursing was the most important factor to attachment, Wisconsin University psychologists Harry and Margaret Harlow investigated the responses of young monkeys. The infants were separated from their biological mothers, and two surrogate mothers were introduced to their cages. One, the wire mother, consisted of a round wooden head, a mesh of cold metal wires, and a bottle of milk from which the baby monkey could drink. The second mother was a foam-rubber form wrapped in a heated terry-cloth blanket. 

The infant monkeys went to the wire mother for food, but they overwhelmingly preferred and spent significantly more time with the warm terry-cloth mother. The warm terry-cloth mother provided no food but did provide comfort (Harlow, 1958). The infant's need for physical closeness and touching is referred to as **contact comfort.** Contact comfort is believed to be the foundation for attachment. The Harlows' studies confirmed that babies have social as well as physical needs. Both monkeys and human babies need a secure base that allows them to feel safe. From this base, they can gain the confidence they need to venture out and explore their worlds.

### Bowlby's Theory

Building on the work of Harlow and others, John Bowlby developed the concept of attachment theory. He defined attachment as the affectional bond or tie that an infant forms with the mother (Bowlby, 1969). An infant must form this bond with a primary caregiver in order to have normal social and emotional development. In addition, Bowlby proposed that this attachment bond is very powerful and continues throughout life. He used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child (Bowlby, 1982). A **secure base** is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as the child explores the surroundings. 

Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment: The caregiver must be responsive to the child's physical, social, and emotional needs; and the caregiver and child must engage in mutually enjoyable interactions (Bowlby, 1969). Additionally, Bowlby observed that infants would go to extraordinary lengths to prevent separation from their parents, such as crying, refusing to be comforted, and waiting for the caregiver to return.

He observed that these same expressions were common to many other mammals, and consequently argued that these negative responses to separation serve an evolutionary function. Because mammalian infants cannot feed or protect themselves, they are dependent upon the care and protection of adults for survival. Thus, those infants who were able to maintain proximity to an attachment figure were more likely to survive and reproduce.

### Mary Ainsworth and the "Strange Situation Technique"

Developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth, a student of John Bowlby, continued studying the development of attachment in infants. Ainsworth and her colleagues created a laboratory test that measured an infant’s attachment to his or her parent. The test is called the "Strange Situation Technique" because it is conducted in a context that is unfamiliar to the child and therefore likely to heighten the child’s need for his or her parent (Ainsworth, 1979).

During the procedure, which lasts about 20 minutes, the parent and the infant are first left alone, while the infant explores the room full of toys. Then a strange adult enters the room and talks for a minute to the parent, after which the parent leaves the room. The stranger stays with the infant for a few minutes, and then the parent again enters, and the stranger leaves the room.

During the entire session, a video camera records the child’s behaviors, which are later coded by trained research assistants. The investigators were especially interested in how the child responded to the parent's leaving and returning to the room, referred to as "the reunion." On the basis of their behaviors, the children are categorized into one of four groups—secure, ambivalent (resistant), avoidant, and disorganized—each demonstrating a different kind of attachment relationship with the parent.

### Erik Erikson and His Stages of Development

Erik Erikson is one of the most influential thinkers on the subject of human development of the last century. Born in Germany in 1902, he studied with Sigmund Freud's daughter, Anna Freud, and several other important psychoanalysts at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute. In 1933, fleeing Hitler, Erikson and his family came to the United States, and he subsequently taught at Massachusetts General Hospital, at Harvard Medical School and Psychological Clinic, Yale University, and the University of California at Berkeley, among other places. Erikson's great interest was in the importance of events in childhood and how they affected later life.

#### Stages of Development

Erikson developed an eight-stage theory of psychosocial development, still relied upon today as a framework for understanding human development. The eight stages are:  
****

**Stage 1: Trust vs. Mistrust**

- Virtue/Desired Outcome: Hope
- Age: 0 to 1½ years

**Stage 2: Autonomy vs. Shame**

- Virtue/Desired Outcome: Will
- Age: 1½ to 3 years

  
**Stage 3: Initiative vs. Guilt**

- Virtue/Desired Outcome: Purpose 
- Age: 3 to 5 years

  
**Stage 4: Industry vs. Inferiority**

- Virtue/Desired Outcome: Competency 
- Age: 5 to 12 years

  
**Stage 5: Identity vs. Role Confusion**

- Virtue/Desired Outcome: Fidelity 
- Age: 12 to 18 years

  
**Stage 6: Intimacy vs. Isolation**

- Virtue/Desired Outcome: Love 
- Age: 18 to 40 years

  
**Stage 7: Generativity vs. Stagnation**

- Virtue/Desired Outcome: Care 
- Age: 40 to 65 years

  
**Stage 8: Ego Integrity vs. Despair**

- Virtue/Desired Outcome: Wisdom 
- Age: 65+ years

### Erikson: Trust vs. Mistrust

Erikson felt strongly about the importance of a secure base, arguing that the most important goal of infancy was the development of a basic sense of trust in one's caregivers. Consequently, the first stage, trust vs. mistrust, highlights the importance of attachment. Erikson maintained that the first year to year and a half of life involves the establishment of a sense of trust (Erikson, 1982).   
  
Infants are dependent and must rely on others to meet their basic physical needs as well as their needs for stimulation and comfort. A caregiver who consistently meets these needs instills a sense of trust or the belief that the world is a trustworthy place. The caregiver should not worry about overly indulging a child's need for comfort, contact, or stimulation.

### Problems Establishing Trust

Erikson (1982) believed that mistrust could contaminate all aspects of one's life and deprive the individual of love and fellowship with others. Consider the implications for establishing trust if a caregiver is unavailable or is upset and ill-prepared to care for a child; if a child is born prematurely or is unwanted; or has physical problems that make him or her less desirable to a parent. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to assume that the parent is going to provide the child with a feeling of trust.

### Measuring Infant Development

The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III) comprehensively assess children within the age range of 1 to 42 months (Pearson Education, 2016). Children are evaluated in five key developmental domains, including cognition, language, social-emotional, motor, and adaptive behavior. By identifying developmental delays in the very young, the Bayley Scales can highlight which early intervention techniques might be most beneficial. Detailed information is even able to be obtained from non-verbal children.

### Next Step

Now move ahead to the next lesson.

### Lesson 8: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about the importance of sleep and the nutritional concerns for toddlers. You will also learn about children's understanding of the world around them, language development, and some disorders in psychosocial development.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in psychosocial development during toddlerhood.

### Sleep Recommendations for Early Childhood

During early childhood, there is a wide variation in the number of hours of sleep recommended per day. For example, two-year-olds may still need 15–16 hours per day, while a six-year-old may only need 7–8 hours.

A graph shows the average hours of sleep recommended, may be appropriate, and not recommended from newborns through older adults. The X-axis shows newborn (0-3 months), infant (4-11 months), toddler (1-2 years), pre-school (3-5 years), school age (6-13 years), teen (14-17 years), young adult (18-25 years), adult (26-64 years), and older adult (65 above). The Y-axis shows 0 through 24 hours. The recommended hours for a newborn are 14-17 hours and the may be appropriate hours are 11-13 or 18-19. The recommended hours for an infant are 12-15 hours and the may be appropriate hours are 10-11 or 16-18. The recommended hours for a toddler are 11-14 hours and the may be appropriate hours are 9-10 or 15-16. The recommended hours for a preschool child are 10-13 hours and the may be appropriate hours are 8-9 or 14. The recommended hours for a school going child are 9-11 hours and the may be appropriate hours are 7-8 or 12. The recommended hours for a teen are 8-10 hours and the may be appropriate hours are 11or 7. The recommended hours for a young adult are 7-9 hours and the may be appropriate hours are 10-11 or 6. The recommended hours for an adult are 7-9 hours and the may be appropriate hours are 10 or 6. The recommended hours for an older adult are 7-8 hours and the may be appropriate hours are 5-6 or 9.

### Nutritional Concerns

In addition to children in early childhood having a smaller appetite, parents may notice a general reticence to try new foods or a preference for certain foods, often served or eaten in a particular way. Some of these changes can be traced back to the "just right" (or just-so) phenomenon that is common in early childhood. Many young children desire consistency and may be upset if there are even slight changes to their daily routines.   
  
They may like to line up their toys or other objects or place them in symmetric patterns. They may arrange the objects until they feel "just right." Many young children have a set bedtime ritual and a strong preference for certain clothes, toys, or games. All these tendencies tend to wane as children approach middle childhood, and the familiarity of such ritualistic behaviors seem to bring a sense of security and general reduction in childhood fears and anxiety (Evans et al., 1999; Evans & Leckman, 2015).

**Malnutrition**

Malnutrition due to insufficient food is not common in developed nations like the United States, yet many children lack a balanced diet. Added sugars and solid fats contribute to 40 percent of daily calories for children and teens in the United States. Approximately half of these empty calories come from six sources: soda, fruit drinks, dairy desserts, grain desserts, pizza, and whole milk (CDC, 2015). Caregivers need to keep in mind that they are setting up taste preferences at this age. Young children who grow accustomed to high-fat, very sweet, and salty flavors may have trouble eating foods that have subtler flavors, such as fruits and vegetables.

### Tips for Establishing Healthy Eating Patterns

Consider the following advice about establishing eating patterns for years to come (Rice, 1997). Notice that keeping mealtime pleasant, providing sound nutrition, and not engaging in power struggles over food are the main goals.

- **Recognize that appetite varies.** Children may eat well at one meal and have no appetite at another. Rather than seeing this as a problem, it may help to realize that appetites do vary. Continue to provide good nutrition, but do not worry excessively if the child does not eat at a particular meal.
- **Keep it pleasant.** This tip is designed to help caregivers create a positive atmosphere during mealtime. Mealtimes should not be the time for arguments or expressing tensions. You do not want the child to have painful memories of mealtimes together or have nervous stomachs and problems eating and digesting food due to stress.
- **No short-order chefs.** While it is fine to prepare foods that children enjoy, preparing a different meal for each child or family member sets up unrealistic expectations from others. Children probably do best when they are hungry, and a meal is ready. Limiting snacks rather than allowing children to "graze" can help create an appetite for what is being served.
- **Limit choices.** If you give your young child choices, make sure that you give them one or two specific choices rather than asking "What would you like for lunch?" If given an open choice, children may change their minds or ask for something that is not available or appropriate.
- **Serve balanced meals.** This tip encourages caregivers to serve **balanced meals**. A box of macaroni and cheese is not a balanced meal. Meals prepared at home tend to have better nutritional value than fast food or frozen dinners.   
**  
Prepared foods** tend to be higher in fat and sugar content, as these ingredients enhance taste and profit margin because fresh food is often costlier and less profitable. However, preparing fresh food at home is not costly. It does, however, require more activity. Preparing meals and including the children in kitchen chores can provide a fun and memorable experience.
- **Do not bribe.** Bribing a child to eat vegetables by promising dessert is not a good idea. The child will likely find a way to get the desert without eating the vegetables (by whining or fidgeting, perhaps, until the caregiver gives in). In addition, bribery teaches the child that some foods are better than others. Children tend to naturally enjoy a variety of foods until they are taught that some are considered less desirable than others. Most important is not to force your child to eat or fight over eating food.

### How Children Understand

Both Piaget and Vygotsky believed that children actively try to understand the world around them, referred to as **constructivism**. However, Piaget is identified as a **cognitive****constructivist**, which means that he focused on independent learning, while Vygotsky is a **social constructivist **who believes in relying on social interactions for learning. More recently, developmentalists have added to this understanding by examining how children organize information and develop their own theories about the world.

Theory

**Theory** is the tendency of children to generate theories to explain everything they encounter. This concept implies that humans are naturally inclined to find reasons and generate explanations for why things occur. Children frequently ask questions about what they see or hear around them.

When the answers provided do not satisfy their curiosity or are too complicated for them to understand, they generate their own theories. In much the same way that scientists construct and revise their theories, children do the same with their intuitions about the world as they encounter new experiences (Gopnik & Wellman, 2012). One of the theories they start to generate in early childhood centers on the mental states—both their own and those of others.

Theory of Mind

**Theory of mind** refers to the ability to think about other people's thoughts. This mental mind reading helps humans to understand and predict the reactions of others, thus playing a crucial role in social development. One common method for determining if a child has reached this mental milestone is the false-belief task. The research began with a clever experiment by Wimmer and Perner (1983), who tested whether children can pass a false-belief test. The child was shown a picture story of Sally, who put her ball in a basket and left the room. While Sally was out of the room, Anne came along and took the ball from the basket and put it inside a box.  
  
The child is then asked where Sally thinks the ball is located when she comes back to the room. Is she going to look first in the box or in the basket? The right answer is that she will look in the basket because that is where she put it and thinks it is, but the child has to infer this false belief against the better knowledge that the ball is in the box. This is very difficult for children before the age of four because of the cognitive effort it takes.   
  
Three-year-olds have difficulty distinguishing between what they once thought was true and what they now know to be true. They feel confident that what they know now is what they have always known (Birch & Bloom, 2003). Even adults need to think through this task (Epley et al., 2004). To be successful at solving this type of task the child must separate what he or she "knows" to be true from what someone else might "think" is true.

In Piagetian terms, children must give up a tendency toward **egocentrism**. The child must also understand that what guides people's actions and responses are what they believe rather than what is reality. In other words, people can mistakenly believe things that are false and will act based on this false knowledge. Consequently, prior to age four, children are rarely successful at solving such a task (Wellman et al., 2001).

Researchers have been concerned by the overemphasis on the mastery of false belief as the primary measure of whether a child has attained theory of mind. Two-year-olds understand the diversity of desires, yet it is not until age four or five that children grasp false belief, and often not until middle childhood do they understand that people may hide how they really feel. This is in part because children in early childhood have difficulty hiding how they really feel. Wellman and his colleagues (Wellman et al., 2006) suggest that theory of mind consists of a number of components, each with its own developmental timeline.

### Erikson's Second Stage: Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt

As the child begins to walk and talk, an interest in independence or autonomy replaces a concern for trust. The toddler tests the limits of what can be touched, said, and explored. Erikson (1982) believed that toddlers should be allowed to explore their environment as freely as safety allows, and in so doing, will develop a sense of independence that will later grow to self-esteem, initiative, and overall confidence.

If a caregiver is overly anxious about the toddler's actions for fear that the child will get hurt or violate others' expectations, the caregiver can give the child the message that they should be ashamed of their behavior and instill a sense of doubt in their own abilities. Parenting advice based on these ideas would be to keep toddlers safe but let them learn by doing.

### Impact of Cultural Differences

Researchers in the United States, Australia, and Germany who investigate children's development of a theory of mind believe it occurs in a specific sequence: 

1. Diverse Desires: understanding that two people may have different desires regarding the same object
2. Diverse Beliefs: understanding that two people may hold different beliefs about an object
3. Knowledge Access: understanding that people may or may not have access to information
4. False Beliefs: understanding that someone might hold a belief based on false information

Yet, Chinese and Iranian preschoolers acquire Knowledge Access before they acquire Diverse Beliefs (Shahaeian, Peterson, Slaughter & Wellman, 2011). Shahaeian and colleagues suggested that cultural differences in child-rearing may account for this reversal. Parents in **collectivistic****cultures**, such as China and Iran, emphasize conformity to the family and cultural values, greater respect for elders, and the acquisition of knowledge and academic skills more than they do autonomy and social skills (Frank, Plunkett & Otten, 2010). This could reduce the degree of familial conflict of opinions expressed in the family.

In contrast, **individualistic cultures** encourage children to think for themselves and assert their own opinion, and this could increase the risk of conflict in beliefs being expressed by family members. As a result, children in individualistic cultures would acquire insight into the diversity of belief earlier, while children in collectivistic cultures would acquire Knowledge Access earlier in the sequence. The role of conflict in aiding the development of theory of mind may account for the earlier age of onset of an understanding of false belief in children with siblings, especially older siblings (McAlister & Petersen, 2007; Perner, Ruffman & Leekman, 1994).

This awareness of the existence of theory of mind is part of social intelligence, such as recognizing that others can think differently about situations. It helps people to be self-conscious or aware that others can think of them in different ways and it helps them be understanding or empathetic toward others. Moreover, this "mind reading ability" helps them anticipate and predict people's actions. The awareness of the mental states of others is important for communication and social skills.

### Language Development

There are various stages of language development in each stage of growth and development in children.

#### Vocabulary Growth

A child's vocabulary expands between the ages of two to six from about 200 words to over 10,000 words. This "vocabulary spurt" typically involves 10 to 20 new words per week. Words are easily learned by making connections between new words and concepts already known. The parts of speech that are learned depend on the language and what is emphasized. Children speaking verb-friendly languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, learn verbs more readily, while those speaking English tend to learn nouns more readily. However, those learning less verb-friendly languages, such as English, seem to need assistance in grammar to master the use of verbs (Imai et al., 2008).

#### Literal Meanings

Children can repeat words and phrases after having heard them only once or twice, but they do not always understand the meaning of the words or phrases. This is especially true of expressions or figures of speech which are taken literally. For example, a classroom full of preschoolers heard the teacher say, "Wow! That was a piece of cake!" The children began asking "Cake? Where is my cake? I want cake!"

#### Overregularization

Children learn rules of grammar as they learn language but may apply these rules inappropriately at first. For instance, a child learns to add "ed" to the end of a word to indicate past tense. Then form a sentence such as "I goed there. I doed that." This is typical at ages two and three. They will soon learn new words such as "went" and "did" to be used in those situations.

#### The Impact of Training

Remember Vygotsky and the Zone of Proximal Development. Children can be assisted in learning language by others who listen attentively, model more accurate pronunciations, and encourage elaboration. The child exclaims, "I'm goed there!" and the adult responds, "You went there? Say, 'I went there.' Where did you go?" Children may be ripe for language, but active participation in helping them learn is important for language development as well. The process of scaffolding is one in which the guide provides needed assistance to the child as a new skill is learned.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder

Autism spectrum disorder is probably the most misunderstood and puzzling of the neurodevelopmental disorders. Children with this disorder show signs of significant disturbances in three main areas: (a) deficits in social interaction, (b) deficits in communication, and (c) repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. These disturbances appear early in life and cause serious impairments in functioning (APA, 2013). Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often face challenges in social communication and interaction.

They may find it difficult to initiate conversations with peers or respond to social cues in typical ways. For example, some children may avoid making eye contact or may not respond when spoken to and may appear to prefer playing alone rather than engaging in group activities. These social difficulties can create a sense of isolation, as individuals with ASD may struggle to navigate the nuances of social interactions, such as understanding body language, facial expressions, and conversational norms. However, it’s important to note that the behaviors associated with ASD can vary widely. Some children may show less interest in social interactions, while others may desire social engagement but struggle with communication skills. Communication deficits can range from a complete lack of speech, to one-word responses (saying only "Yes" or "No" when replying to questions), to echoed speech (for example, parroting what another person says, either immediately or several hours or even days later), and to having difficulty maintaining a conversation because of an inability to reciprocate others' comments. These deficits can also include problems in using and understanding nonverbal cues (facial expressions, gestures, and postures) that facilitate normal communication.

Repetitive patterns of behavior or interests can be exhibited in a number of ways. The child might engage in stereotyped, repetitive movements (rocking, head-banging, or repeatedly dropping an object and then picking it up), or might show great distress at small changes in routine or the environment. For example, the child might throw a temper tantrum if an object is not in its proper place or if a regularly scheduled activity is rescheduled.

In some cases, the person with autism spectrum disorder might show highly restricted and fixated interests that appear to be abnormal in their intensity. For instance, the child might learn and memorize every detail about trains even though doing so serves no apparent purpose. Importantly, autism spectrum disorder is not the same thing as intellectual disability, although these two conditions can occur together. It is clear, however, that the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder are not caused or explained by intellectual disability.

Spectrum

The qualifier "spectrum" in autism spectrum disorder is used to indicate that individuals with the disorder can show a range, or spectrum, of symptoms that vary in their magnitude and severity. Some are severe; others, less severe. The previous edition of the DSM included a diagnosis of Asperger disorder, generally recognized as a less severe form of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals diagnosed with Asperger disorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary, but exhibiting impairments in social interaction and social communication, such as talking only about their special interests (Wing et al., 2011).   
  
However, because research has failed to demonstrate that Asperger disorder differs from autism spectrum disorder, the DSM-5 does not include it. Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder, particularly those with better language and intellectual skills, can live and work independently as adults. However, most do not because the symptoms cause serious impairment in many aspects of life (APA, 2013).

### Current Prevalence Rate of Disorder

To determine current prevalence rates, the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) network provides estimates of the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders among 8-year-old children who reside within 11 ADM sites in the United States: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin (Baio et al., 2018). For 2014 (the year for which there is the most recent data), estimates indicated that nearly one in 59 children in the United States has autism spectrum disorder, and the disorder is four times more common in boys (one out of 38) than in girls (one out of 152).

Rates of autism spectrum disorder have increased dramatically since the 1980s. For example, California saw an increase of 273 percent in reported cases from 1987 through 1998 (Byrd, 2002). Between 2000 and 2008, the rate of autism diagnoses in the United States increased by 78 percent (CDC, 2012) and between 2000 and 2014 the rate increased 150 percent (Baio et al., 2018). Although it is difficult to interpret this increase, it is possible that the rise in prevalence is the result of the broadening of the diagnosis, increased efforts to identify cases in the community, and greater awareness and acceptance of the diagnosis. In addition, mental health professionals are now more knowledgeable about autism spectrum disorder and are better equipped to make the diagnosis, even in subtle cases (Novella, 2008).

Autism Spectrum Disorder: Causes

The exact causes of autism spectrum disorder remain unknown despite massive research efforts over the last two decades (Meek et al., 2013). Autism appears to be strongly influenced by genetics, as identical twins show concordance rates of 60 to 90 percent, whereas rates for fraternal twins and siblings are 5 to 10 percent (Autism Genome Project Consortium, 2007).

Many different genes and gene mutations have been implicated in autism (Meek et al., 2013). Among the genes involved are those important in the formation of synaptic circuits that facilitate communication among different areas of the brain (Gauthier et al., 2011). A number of environmental factors are also thought to be associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder, at least in part, because they contribute to new mutations. These factors include exposure to pollutants such as plant emissions and mercury, urban versus rural residence, and vitamin D deficiency (Kinney et al., 2009).

A recent Swedish study looking at the records of over one million children born between 1973 and 2014 found that exposure to prenatal infections increased the risk for autism spectrum disorders (al-Haddad et al., 2019). Children born to mothers with an infection during pregnancy have a 79 percent increase in the risk of autism. Infections included sepsis, flu, pneumonia, meningitis, encephalitis, an infection of the placental tissues or kidneys, and a urinary tract infection. One possible reason for the autism diagnosis is that the fetal brain is extremely vulnerable to damage from infections and inflammation. These results highlighted the importance of pregnant women receiving a flu vaccination and avoiding any infections during pregnancy.

There is no scientific evidence that a link exists between autism and vaccinations (Hughes, 2007). Indeed, a recent study compared the vaccination histories of 256 children with autism spectrum disorder with that of 752 control children across three time periods during their first two years of life—birth to three months, birth to seven months, and birth to two years (DeStefano et al., 2013). At the time of the study, the children were between 6 and 13 years old, and their prior vaccination records were obtained. 

Because vaccines contain immunogens (substances that fight infections), the investigators examined medical records to see how many immunogens children received to determine if those children who received more immunogens were at greater risk for developing autism spectrum disorder. The results of this study clearly demonstrated that the quantity of immunogens from vaccines received during the first two years of life were not at all related to the development of autism spectrum disorder.

### Key Term

### Next Step

Now move ahead to the next lesson.

### Lesson 9:  Introduction

To an extent, instinct, which might be called genetically transmitted information, is responsible for the way people react to situations or display emotions. However, expression of emotions also influences the psychosocial development of the individual.

In this lesson, you will follow the psychosocial development of children from birth through early childhood, learning about the changes in self-concept and self-esteem and theories of gender development.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain how emotions influence psychosocial development from birth through early childhood.

### Erikson: Initiative vs. Guilt

For Erikson, the trust and autonomy of the two previous stages develop into a desire to take initiative or to think of ideas and initiative action (Erikson, 1982). Children may want to build a fort with cushions from the living room couch or open a lemonade stand in the driveway or make a zoo with their stuffed animals and issue tickets to those who want to come. Or they may just want to get themselves ready for bed without any assistance.   
  
To reinforce taking initiative, caregivers should offer praise for the child's efforts and avoid being critical of messes or mistakes. Placing pictures of drawings on the refrigerator, purchasing mud pies for dinner, and admiring towers of Legos will facilitate the child's sense of initiative.

### Self-Concept and Self-Esteem

#### Self-Concept 

Early childhood is a time of forming an initial sense of self. **Self-concept** is a person's self-description, including both external and internal qualities. 

#### Self-Esteem

In contrast to self-concept, **self-esteem** is an evaluative judgment about who a person is, by that person. The emergence of cognitive skills in this age group results in improved perceptions of the self. If asked to describe yourself to others, you would likely provide some physical descriptors, group affiliation, personality traits, behavioral quirks, values, and beliefs.   
  
When researchers ask young children the same open-ended question, the children provide physical descriptors, preferred activities, and favorite possessions. Thus, a little girl might describe herself as a three-year-old girl with red hair who likes to play with Legos. This focus on external qualities is referred to as the **categorical self**. 

#### Self-Knowledge

However, even children as young as three know that there is more to themselves than these external characteristics. Harter and Pike (1984) challenged the method of measuring personality with an open-ended question as they felt that language limitations were hindering the ability of young children to express their self-knowledge. They suggested a change to the method of measuring self-concept in young children, whereby researchers provide statements that ask whether something is true of the child (for example, "I like to boss people around" or "I am happy most of the time").   
  
Consistent with Harter and Pike's suspicions, small children answer these statements in an internally consistent manner, especially after the age of four (Goodvin et al., 2008), and often give similar responses to what others (parents and teachers) say about the child (Brown et al., 2008; Colwell & Lindsey, 2003).

#### Self-Evaluation

Young children tend to have a generally positive self-image. This optimism is often the result of a lack of social comparison when making self-evaluations (Ruble et al., 1980) and of a comparison between what the child could once do with what she can do now (Kemple, 1995).   
  
However, this does not mean that preschool children are exempt from negative self-evaluations. Preschool children with insecure attachments to their caregivers tend to have lower self-esteem at age four (Goodvin et al., 2008). Maternal negative affect was also found by Goodwin and her colleagues to produce more negative self-evaluations in preschool children.

### Gender

Another important dimension of the self is the sense of self as male or female. Preschool-aged children become increasingly interested in finding out the differences between boys and girls, both physically and in terms of what activities are acceptable for each. While two-year-olds can identify some differences and learn whether they are boys or girls, preschoolers become more interested in what it means to be male or female.   
  
**Gender** is the cultural, social, and psychological meanings associated with masculinity and femininity (Spears Brown & Jewell, 2018). A person's sense of self as a member of a particular gender is known as **gender identity**. The development of gender identity appears to be due to an interaction among biological, social, and representational influences (Ruble et al., 2006). **Gender roles**, or the expectations associated with being male or female, are learned in one's culture throughout childhood and into adulthood.

### Gender socialization

**Gender socialization** focuses on what young children learn about gender from society, including parents, peers, media, religious institutions, schools, and public policies. Children learn about what is acceptable for females and males early and, in fact, this socialization may even begin the moment a parent learns that a child is on the way. Knowing the sex of the child can conjure up images of the child's behavior, appearance, and potential on the part of a parent, and this stereotyping continues to guide perception throughout life. Consider parents of newborns.   
  
Shown a 7-pound, 20-inch baby wrapped in blue (a color designating males), they describe the child as tough, strong, and angry when crying. Shown the same infant in pink (a color used in the United States for baby girls), these parents are likely to describe the baby as pretty, delicate, and frustrated when crying (Maccoby & Jacklin, 1987). Female infants are held more, talked to more frequently, and given direct eye contact, while male infant interactions are often mediated through a toy or activity.

#### Boys' and Girls' Roles

As they age, sons are given tasks that take them outside the house and that have to be performed only on occasion, while girls are more likely to be given chores inside the home, such as cleaning or cooking, that are performed daily. Sons are encouraged to think for themselves when they encounter problems, and daughters are more likely to be given assistance, even when they are working on an answer.   
  
Parents also talk to their children differently according to their gender. For example, parents talk to sons more in detail about science, and they discuss numbers and counting twice as often as they do with daughters (Chang et al., 2011). How are these beliefs about behaviors and expectations based on gender transmitted to children?

### Theories of Gender Development

#### Social Learning Theory

One theory of gender development in children is **social learning theory**, which argues that behavior is learned through observation, modeling, reinforcement, and punishment (Bandura, 1997). Children are rewarded and reinforced for behaving in concordance with gender roles that have been presented to them since birth and punished for breaking gender roles. In addition, social learning theory states that children learn many of their gender roles by modeling the behavior of adults and older children and, in doing so, develop ideas about what behaviors are appropriate for each gender. 

#### Cognitive Social Learning Theory

**Cognitive social learning theory** also emphasizes reinforcement, punishment, and imitation, but adds cognitive processes. These processes include attention, self-regulation, and self-efficacy. Once children learn the significance of gender, they regulate their own behavior based on internalized gender norms (Bussey & Bandura, 1999). 

#### Gender Schema Theory

Another theory is that children develop their own conceptions of the attributes associated with maleness or femaleness, which is referred to as **gender schema theory** (Bem, 1981). Once children have identified with a particular gender, they seek out information about gender traits, behaviors, and roles. This theory is more constructivist, as children are actively acquiring their gender. For example, friends discuss what is acceptable for boys and girls, and popularity may be based on what is considered ideal behavior for their gender.

#### Developmental Intergroup Theory

**Developmental intergroup theory** states that many gender stereotypes are so strong because people emphasize gender so much in culture (Bigler & Liben, 2007). Developmental intergroup theory postulates that adults' heavy focus on gender leads children to pay attention to gender as a key source of information about themselves and others, to seek out any possible gender differences, and to form rigid stereotypes based on gender that are subsequently difficult to change.

### Transgender Children

#### Transgender 

Many young children do not conform to the gender roles modeled by the culture and even push back against assigned roles. However, a small percentage of children actively reject the toys, clothing, and anatomy of their assigned sex and state they prefer the toys, clothing, and anatomy of the opposite sex. Approximately 0.3 percent of the U.S. population identify as **transgender**, or identifying with the gender opposite their natal sex (Olson & Gülgöz, 2018).

Transgender adults have stated that they identified with the opposite gender as soon as they began talking (Russo, 2016). Some of these children may experience **gender dysphoria**, or distress accompanying a mismatch between one's gender identity and biological sex (APA, 2013), while other children do not experience discomfort regarding their gender identity. 

Current research is now looking at those young children who identify as transgender and have socially transitioned. In 2013, a longitudinal study following 300 socially transitioned transgender children between the ages of 3 and 12 began (Olson & Gülgöz, 2018). Socially transitioned transgender children identify with the gender opposite than the one assigned at birth, and they change their appearance and pronouns to reflect their gender identity.

Findings from the study indicated that the gender development of these socially transitioned children looked similar to the gender development of **cisgender** children, or those whose gender and sex assignment at birth matched. These socially transitioned transgender children exhibited similar gender preferences and gender identities as their gender matched peers. Further, these children who were living every day according to their gender identity and were supported by their families exhibited positive mental health.

#### Intersex

Some individuals who identify as transgender are **intersex**; that is, born with either an absence or some combination of male and female reproductive organs, sex hormones, or sex chromosomes (Jarne & Auld, 2006). In humans, intersex individuals make up more than 150 million people, or about 2 percent of the world's population (Blackless et al., 2000). There are dozens of intersex conditions, and intersex individuals demonstrate the diverse variations of biological sex. Some examples of intersex conditions include:

- **Turner syndrome**, or the absence of, or an imperfect, second X chromosome 
- **Congenital adrenal hyperplasia**, or a genetic disorder caused by an increased production of androgens 
- **Androgen insensitivity syndrome**, or when a person has one X and one Y chromosome but is resistant to the male hormones or androgens

Greater attention to the rights of children born intersex is occurring in the medical field, and intersex children and their parents should work closely with specialists to ensure that these children develop positive gender identities. 

#### Gender Value in Children

Starting at birth, children learn the social meanings of gender from adults and their culture. Gender roles and expectations are especially portrayed in children's toys, books, commercials, video games, movies, television shows, and music (Knorr, 2017).

Therefore, when children make choices regarding their gender identification, expression, and behavior that may be contrary to gender stereotypes, it is important that they feel supported by the caring adults in their lives. This support allows children to feel valued and resilient, and to develop a secure sense of self (American Academy of Pediatricians, 2015).

### Next Step

Now move ahead to the next lesson.

### Lesson 10: Introduction

Between three and five, socialization becomes important, and emotional and behavioral development are greatly influenced by a young child's environment.

In this lesson, you will learn about the importance of play, the challenges of child care for working families, and the dangers of child abuse and neglect for small children.  

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain how emotions influence behavior from birth through early childhood.

### Play

Freud saw play as a means for children to release pent-up emotions and to deal with emotionally distressing situations in a more secure environment. Vygotsky and Piaget saw play as a way children developed their intellectual abilities (Dyer & Moneta, 2006). All three theorists saw play as providing positive outcomes for children. Parten (1932) observed two-to-five-year-old children and noted six types of play: Three labeled non-social play (unoccupied, solitary, and onlooker) and three categorized as social play (parallel, associative, and cooperative).

### Parten’s Classification of Types of Play in Preschool Children  
  

#### Table S1 L10.1, Parten's Classification of Types of Play in Preschool Children
CategoryDescriptionUnoccupied Play Children's behavior seems more random and without a specific goal. This is the least common form of play.Solitary PlayChildren play by themselves, do not interact with others, and do not engage in similar activities as other children around them. Onlooker PlayChildren are observing other children playing. They may comment on the activities and even make suggestions, but they will not directly join the play.Parallel PlayChildren play alongside each other, using similar toys, but do not directly interact with each other.Associative PlayChildren will interact with each other and share toys, but they are not working toward a common goal.Cooperative PlayChildren are interacting to achieve a common goal. Children may take on different tasks to reach that goal. 
### Imaginary Companions

An intriguing occurrence in early childhood is the emergence of imaginary companions. Researchers differ in how they define what qualifies as an imaginary companion. Some studies include only invisible characters that the child refers to in conversation or plays with for an extended period of time. Other researchers also include objects that the child personifies, such as a stuffed toy or doll, or characters the child impersonates every day. Estimates of the number of children who have imaginary companions varies greatly (from as little as 6 percent to as high as 65 percent) depending on what is included in the definition (Gleason et al., 2000). 

Little is known about why children create imaginary companions, and more than half of all companions have no obvious trigger in the child’s life (Masih, 1978). Imaginary companions are sometimes based on real people, characters from stories, or simply names the child has heard (Gleason, et. al., 2000). Imaginary companions often change over time. In their study, Gleason et al. (2000) found that 40 percent of the imaginary companions of the children they studied changed, such as developing superpowers, switching age, gender, or even dying, and 68 percent of the characteristics of the companion were acquired over time. This could reflect greater complexity in the child’s “creation” over time and/or a greater willingness to talk about their imaginary playmates. 

In addition, research suggests that contrary to the assumption that children with imaginary companions are compensating for poor social skills, several studies have found that these children are very sociable (Mauro, 1991; Singer & Singer, 1990; Gleason, 2002). However, studies have reported that children with imaginary companions are more likely to be first-borns or only children (Masih, 1978; Gleason et al., 2000, Gleason, 2002).

However, not all research has found a link between birth order and the incidence of imaginary playmates (Manosevitz, Prentice, & Wilson, 1973). Moreover, some studies have found little or no difference in the presence of imaginary companions and parental divorce (Gleason et al., 2000), number of people in the home, or the amount of time children are spending with real playmates (Masih, 1978; Gleason & Hohmann, 2006). 

Do children treat real friends differently? The answer appears to be ... not really. Young children view their relationship with their imaginary companion to be as supportive and nurturing as with their real friends. Gleason has suggested that this might suggest that children form a schema of what is a friend and use this same schema in their interactions with both types of friends (Gleason, et al., 2000; Gleason, 2002; Gleason & Hohmann, 2006).

### Child Care

In 2018, about 71.5 percent of mothers of school-aged and 65.1 percent of mothers of preschool-aged children in the United States worked outside the home (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). Since more women have been entering the workplace, there has been a concern that families do not spend as much time with their children. This, however, is not true. The Economist Data Team (2017) analyzed data from ten countries (United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Slovenia, and Spain) and estimated that the average mother spent 54 minutes a day caring for children in 1965, but 104 minutes in 2012. Only mothers in France spent more time in 2012 than in 1965.   
  
Men continue to do less than women at 59 minutes per day in 2012, but they provided more care than in 1965 when they averaged only 16 minutes a day. However, differences were found between working-class and middle-class mothers. In 1965 mothers with and without a university education spent about the same amount of time on child care. By 2012, the more educated ones were spending half an hour more per day.

#### National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 

To evaluate how early child care affects children’s development, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (2006) conducted a longitudinal study. This study is considered the most comprehensive child care study to date, and it began in 1991 when the children were one month of age. The study included an economically and ethnically diverse group of 1,364 children assessed from 10 sites around the country.   
  
By design, the study involved single parents, minority backgrounds, and differing formal education levels. Child care was defined as "any care provided on a regular basis by someone other than the child's mother." A "regular basis" included more than 10 hours per week. Child care arrangements included care from the father or another relative, care from a caregiver not related to the child in the child's home, small group care in the caregiver's home, and center-based care.

Overall results indicated that children cared for by their mothers did not develop differently than those who were cared for by others. Parents and family characteristics were stronger predictors of child development than child care facilities. Specifically, greater cognitive, language, and social competence were demonstrated when parents were more educated, had higher incomes, and provided emotionally supportive and cognitively enriched home environments.   
  
When comparing higher-quality child care with lower-quality child care, differences were noted. Higher quality care, as measured by adult-to-child ratios, group size, and caregivers' educational and training levels, resulted in higher cognitive performance, better language comprehension and production, and higher levels of school readiness. Lower quality care predicted more behavioral problems and poorer cognitive, language, and school readiness.

#### Child Care Providers

The higher the teacher-to-child ratio, the more time the teacher has for involvement with the children and the less stressed the teacher may be so that the interactions can be more relaxed, stimulating, and positive. The more children there are in a program, the less desirable the program. This is because the center may be more rigid in rules and structure to accommodate the large number of children in the facility. The physical environment should be colorful, stimulating, clean, and safe.   
  
The philosophy of the organization and the curriculum available should be child-centered, positive, and stimulating. Providers should be trained in early childhood education. A majority of states do not require training for their child care providers. While formal education is not required for a person to provide a warm, loving relationship to a child, knowledge of a child’s development is useful for addressing their social, emotional, and cognitive needs in an effective way. 

By working toward improving the quality of childcare and increasing family-friendly workplace policies, such as more flexible scheduling and childcare facilities at places of employment, families with smaller children can be better supported and parents can be relieved of the stress sometimes associated with managing work and family life.

### Child Abuse

The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2013) defines **child abuse and neglect **as: Any recent act or failure to act on part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation; or an act or failure to act, which presents an imminent risk of serious harm.   
  
Each state has its own definition of child abuse based on the federal law, and most states recognize four major types of maltreatment: neglect, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, and sexual abuse. Each of the forms of child maltreatment may be identified alone, but they can occur in combination.

#### Victims of Child Abuse 

According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (2019), during 2017 (the year for which the most recent data is available) Child Protective Services (CPS) agencies received an estimated 4.1 million referrals for abuse involving approximately 7.5 million children. This is a rate of 31.8 per 1,000 children in the national population. Professionals made 65.7 percent of alleged child abuse and neglect reports, and they included law enforcement (18.3 percent), educators (19.4 percent), and social services personnel (11.7 percent). Nonprofessionals, such as friends, neighbors, and relatives, submitted 17.3 percent of the reports. Approximately 3.5 million children were the subjects of at least one report.

**Sexual abuse **is one form of child abuse that includes a wide range of actions between a child and an adult or older child. Often these involve body contact but exposing one's genitals or using a child for pornography is also sexual abuse (HHS, 2021). 

Research estimates that one out of four girls and one out of ten boys have been sexually abused (CDC, 2021). The median age for sexual abuse is eight or nine years for both boys and girls (Finkelhorn et al., 1990). Most boys and girls are sexually abused by a male. Although rates of sexual abuse are higher for girls than for boys, boys may be less likely to report abuse because of the cultural expectation that boys should be able to take care of themselves and because of the stigma attached to homosexual encounters (Finkelhorn et al., 1990). 

Ninety-one percent of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by someone the child or child’s family knows (CDC 2021).  Sexual abuse can create feelings of self-blame, betrayal, shame, and guilt (Valente, 2005). Sexual abuse is particularly damaging when the perpetrator is someone the child trusts and may lead to depression, anxiety, problems with intimacy, and suicide (Valente, 2005).

#### Stress on Young Children

Children experience different types of stressors. Normal, everyday stress can provide an opportunity for young children to build coping skills and poses little risk to development. Even more long-lasting stressful events, such as changing schools or losing a loved one, can be managed fairly well. Children who experience toxic stress or who live in extremely stressful situations of abuse over long periods of time can suffer long-lasting effects.   
  
The structures in the midbrain or limbic systems, such as the hippocampus and amygdala, can be vulnerable to prolonged stress during early childhood (Middlebrooks & Audage, 2008). High levels of the stress hormone cortisol can reduce the size of the hippocampus and affect the child's memory abilities. Stress hormones can also reduce immunity to disease. The brain exposed to long periods of severe stress can develop a low threshold making the child hypersensitive to stress in the future.

### Adverse Childhood Experiences

The toxic stress that young children endure can have a significant impact on their later lives. According to Merrick et al. (2018), the foundation for lifelong health and well-being is created in childhood, as positive experiences strengthen biological systems while adverse experiences can increase mortality and morbidity.   
  
All types of abuse, neglect, and other potentially traumatic experiences that occur before the age of 18 are referred to as **adverse childhood experiences** (ACEs) (CDC, 2019). ACEs have been linked to risky behaviors, chronic health conditions, low life potential, and early death, and as the number of ACEs increases, so does the risk for these results.

#### Impacts

When a child experiences strong, frequent, or prolonged adversity without adequate adult support, the child's stress response systems can be activated and disrupt the development of the brain and other organ systems (Harvard University, 2019). Further, ACEs can increase the risk for stress-related disease and cognitive impairment, well into adulthood. Felitti et al. (1998) found that those who had experienced four or more ACEs compared to those who had experienced none had increased health risks for alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, suicide attempt, increase in smoking, poor self-rated health, more sexually transmitted diseases, an increase in physical inactivity, and severe obesity.

#### Separating Families at the United States Border

Thousands of children were separated from their parents by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as they approached the United States border beginning in April 2018. Children were placed in separate facilities from their parents when they were being processed, and they were not told when they would be reunited. When enduring stressful situations, separation from one's parents can be extremely detrimental to a child (Society for Research in Child Development [SRCD], 2018).   
  
Parental separations affect children's stress management systems by changing how the body responds to stress. Long-term stress can disrupt brain functioning, cognitive skills, emotional processing, and physiological health. When exposed to stress, children typically look to their parents for support and care, and parents can reduce children’s stress. These separated children were already under extreme stress escaping their previous homes and then were separated from the individuals who could support them through this process.

### Key Term

- **adverse childhood experiences:** potential traumatic experiences that occur in childhood, such as abuse, neglect, and violence, that may have a crucial impact on an individual’s physical, mental, and emotional health all through life

### Lesson 11: Introduction

Culture refers to a way of life—the knowledge, beliefs, language, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of a group of people. It defines how people communicate and behave in society. Culture plays an integral role in the development of humans. It not only imposes societal norms and laws, it also shapes the values and beliefs of an individual. Consequently, parents of certain cultural backgrounds tend to nurture their children according to the established culture within their society.

In this lesson, you will discover the influence of culture on a child’s first words, emotional displays, and manifested behaviors as well as on their parents' parenting styles.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Describe examples of cultural practices and perspectives influencing behavior during the newborn period.

### First Words and Cultural Influences

If the child is using English, first words tend to be nouns. Children label objects such as cup, ball, or other items that they regularly interact with. In a verb-friendly language such as Chinese, however, children may learn more verbs. This may also be due to the different emphasis given to objects based on culture. Chinese children may be taught to notice action and relationships between objects, while children from the United States may be taught to name an object and its qualities (color, texture, size, etc.). These differences can be seen when comparing interpretations of art by older students from China and the United States (Imai et al., 2008).1

### Baumrind’s Parenting Styles

Relationships between parents and children continue to play a significant role in children’s development during early childhood. As children mature, parent-child relationships naturally change. Preschool and grade-school children are more capable, have their own preferences, and sometimes refuse or seek to compromise with parental expectations. This can lead to greater parent-child conflict, and how conflict is managed by parents further shapes the quality of parent-child relationship.1

Parenting style refers to the way in which parents choose to raise their children. The way that people parent is an important factor in their children's socioemotional growth and development. In her research, Baumrind (1966) found what she considered to be the two basic elements that help shape successful parenting: parental responsiveness and parental demandingness. Through her studies, Baumrind identified three initial parenting styles: authoritative parenting, authoritarian parenting, and permissive parenting. Maccoby and Martin (1983) later expanded upon Baumrind’s three original parenting styles by adding the uninvolved or neglectful style, which has the most pervasive negative consequences across all domains. While not every parent falls neatly into one category, these parenting styles generally correspond with the type of discipline a parent chooses to use.2

Baumrind (1971) identified a model of parenting that focuses on the level of control or expectations that parents have regarding their children and how warm or responsive they are. This model resulted in four parenting styles:

- Authoritative
- Authoritarian
- Permissive
- Uninvolved1

### Four Parenting Styles

#### Authoritative

In general, children develop greater competence and self-confidence when parents have high but reasonable expectations for children’s behavior; communicate well with them; are warm, loving, and responsive; and use reasoning, rather than coercion as preferred responses to children’s misbehavior. This kind of parenting style has been described as authoritative (Baumrind, 2013). **Authoritative parents** are supportive and show interest in their kids’ activities but are not overbearing and allow them to make constructive mistakes. Parents allow negotiation where appropriate and, consequently, this type of parenting is considered more democratic.1

Authoritative parenting is a commonly advocated approach to parenting in the United States because of its high level of involvement and balanced levels of control. Authoritative parents set realistic expectations and consistent limits for their children and provide them with fair or natural consequences. Natural consequences are those that occur as a natural result of the child's behavior (or lack of a particular behavior), with no intervention required; for example, if a child refuses to wear sneakers, being unable to play at the playground is a natural consequence. Authoritative parents express warmth and affection, listen to their child's point of view, and provide opportunities for independence. Parents set rules and explain the reasons behind them, and they are also flexible and willing to make exceptions to the rules in certain cases—for example, temporarily relaxing bedtime rules to allow for a nighttime swim during a family vacation.2

Of the four parenting styles, the authoritative style is the one that is most encouraged in modern American society. American children raised by authoritative parents tend to have high self-esteem and well-developed social skills and work well with others. However, effective parenting styles vary as a function of culture, and the authoritative style is not necessarily preferred or appropriate in all cultures.2

#### Authoritarian

In the authoritarian style, parents put a high value on conformity and obedience. The parents are often strict, tightly monitor their children, and exhibit a large amount of control over their child's decisions and behavior. **Authoritarian parents** set rigid rules with firm consequences; in contrast to the authoritative style, authoritarian parents probably would not relax bedtime rules during vacation because they consider the rules to be set, and they expect obedience at all times.2

Children who grow up in authoritarian homes can become anxious or withdrawn or suffer from self-esteem problems. If these children do poorly in school, they do not tend to engage in antisocial behavior for fear of their parents' reaction. However, it is important to keep in mind that children from specific cultures may respond better to one parenting style than to other styles. For instance, first-generation Chinese American children raised by authoritarian parents did just as well in school as peers who were raised by authoritative parents (Russell et al., 2010).2

Authoritarian is the traditional model of parenting in which parents make the rules and children are expected to be obedient. Baumrind suggests that authoritarian parents tend to place maturity demands on their children that are unreasonably high and tend to be aloof and distant. Consequently, children reared in this way may fear rather than respect their parents and, because their parents do not allow discussion, may take out their frustrations on safer targets perhaps as bullies toward peers.1

#### Permissive

Permissive parenting tends to be warm and loving but lacks follow-through on setting limits or rules. **Permissive parents** tend to be overindulgent, make few demands, rarely use punishment, and allow their children to make their own decisions, regardless of the consequences. They tend to be very nurturing and loving and may play the role of a friend rather than the role of a parent. These parents might be caught up in their own lives and therefore inattentive (although not neglectful) and exhibit little control over their children.2

Children raised by permissive parents tend to lack self-discipline, and the permissive parenting style is negatively associated with grades (Dornbusch et al., 1987). The permissive style may also contribute to other risky or impulsive behaviors such as alcohol abuse (Bahr & Hoffman, 2010), risky sexual behavior, especially among female children (Donenberg et al., 2002), and increased display of disruptive behaviors by male children (Parent et al., 2011). However, there are some positive outcomes associated with children raised by permissive parents: many tend to have higher self-esteem and better social skills and report lower levels of depression (Darling, 1999).2

Permissive parenting involves holding expectations of children that are below what could be reasonably expected from them. Children are allowed to make their own rules and determine their own activities. Parents are warm and communicative but provide little structure for their children. Children fail to learn self-discipline and may feel somewhat insecure because they do not know the limits (Lally & Valentine-French, 2019).1

#### Uninvolved

With the uninvolved style of parenting, the parents are indifferent and sometimes referred to as neglectful. They don’t respond to their child’s needs and make relatively few demands. This could be because of severe depression, substance abuse, or other factors such as the parents’ extreme focus on work. Neglectful parents may look to their children for support and guidance, and these children often end up "parenting their parents." These parents may provide for the child’s basic needs, but little else; in more extreme forms of neglect, basic needs may not be cared for at all or children may be placed in harmful situations.2

These children, much like those raised in permissive homes, tend to have myriad problems, but often the problems are often much more serious. Children raised in this parenting style are usually emotionally withdrawn, fearful, and anxious; perform poorly in school; and are at an increased risk of substance abuse (Darling, 1999).2

These children can suffer in school and in their relationships with their peers (Gecas & Seff, 1991). **Uninvolved parents** are disengaged from their children. They do not make demands on their children and are non-responsive.1

### Comparison of Parenting Styles

Keep in mind that most parents do not follow any model completely. Real people tend to fall somewhere in between these styles. Sometimes parenting styles change from one child to the next or in times when the parent has more or less time and energy for parenting. Parenting styles can also be affected by concerns the parent has in other areas of their life. For example, parenting styles tend to become more authoritarian when parents are tired and perhaps more authoritative when they are more energetic.1  
  
Sometimes parents seem to change their parenting approach when others are around, maybe because they become more self-conscious as parents or are concerned with giving others the impression that they are a “tough” parent or an “easygoing” parent. Additionally, parenting styles may reflect the type of parenting someone saw modeled while growing up. See the table for Baumrind’s parenting style descriptions.1

### Impact of Culture on Parenting Styles

The impact of culture and class cannot be ignored when examining parenting styles. The model of parenting described above assumes that the authoritative style is the best because this style is designed to help the parent raise a child who is independent, self-reliant, and responsible. These are qualities favored in “individualistic” cultures such as the United States, particularly by the middle class. However, in “collectivistic” cultures such as China or Korea, being obedient and compliant are favored behaviors.1

Authoritarian parenting has been used historically and reflects the cultural need for children to do as they are told. African American, Hispanic, and Asian parents tend to be more authoritarian than non-Hispanic whites. In societies where family members’ cooperation is necessary for survival, rearing children who are independent and who strive to be on their own makes no sense. However, in an economy based on being mobile in order to find jobs and where one’s earnings are based on education, raising a child to be independent is very important.1

In a classic study on social class and parenting styles, Kohn (1977) explains that parents tend to emphasize qualities that are needed for their own survival when parenting their children. Working-class parents are rewarded for being obedient, reliable, and honest in their jobs. They are not paid to be independent or to question the management; rather, they move up and are considered good employees if they show up on time, do their work as they are told, and can be counted on by their employers. Consequently, these parents reward honesty and obedience in their children.1

Middle-class parents who work as professionals are rewarded for taking initiative, being self-directed, and being assertive in their jobs. They are required to get the job done without being told exactly what to do. They are asked to be innovative and to work independently. These parents encourage their children to have those qualities as well by rewarding independence and self-reliance. Parenting styles can reflect many elements of culture.1

### Primary and Secondary Emotions

Emotions are often divided into two general categories: Basic emotions—also called **"primary" emotions**—such as interest, happiness, anger, fear, surprise, sadness, and disgust, which appear first, and self-conscious emotions—also called **"secondary" emotions**—such as envy, pride, shame, guilt, doubt, and embarrassment. Unlike primary emotions, secondary emotions appear as children start to develop a self-concept and require social instruction on when to feel such emotions.

The situations in which children learn self-conscious emotions vary from culture to culture. Individualistic cultures teach people to feel pride in personal accomplishments, while in more collectivist cultures, children are taught to not call attention to themselves, unless they wish to feel embarrassed for doing so (Akimoto & Sanbinmatsu, 1999).

### Attachment Styles

On the basis of their behaviors, children are categorized into one of four groups where each group reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the caregiver. One style is secure and the other three styles are referred to as insecure.

#### Secure Attachment Style

A child with a **secure attachment style** usually explores freely while the caregiver is present and may engage with the stranger. The child will typically play with the toys and bring one to the caregiver to show and describe from time to time. The child may be upset when the caregiver departs but is also happy to see the caregiver return.

#### Ambivalent Attachment Style

A child with an **ambivalent** (sometimes called resistant) **attachment style** is wary about the situation in general, particularly the stranger, and stays close or even clings to the caregiver rather than exploring the toys. When the caregiver leaves, the child is extremely distressed and is ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The child may rush to the caregiver but then fails to be comforted when picked up. The child may still be angry and even resist attempts to be soothed.

#### Avoidant Attachment Style

A child with an **avoidant attachment style** will avoid or ignore the mother, showing little emotion when the mother departs or returns. The child may run away from the mother when she approaches. The child will not explore very much, regardless of who is there, and the stranger will not be treated much differently from the mother.

#### Disorganized or Disoriented Attachment Style

A child with a **disorganized or disoriented attachment style** seems to have an inconsistent way of coping with the stress of the stranger situation. The child may cry during the separation, but avoid the mother when she returns, or the child may approach the mother but then freeze or fall to the floor. 

How common are the various attachment styles among children in the United States? It is estimated that about 65 percent of children in the United States are securely attached. Twenty percent exhibit avoidant styles and 10 to 15 percent are ambivalent. Another 5 to 10 percent may be characterized as disorganized (Ainsworth et al., 1978).

Some cultural differences in attachment styles have been found (Rothbaum et al., 2010). For example, German parents value independence and Japanese mothers are typically by their children’s sides. As a result, the rate of insecure-avoidant attachments is higher in Germany and insecure-resistant attachments are higher in Japan. These differences reflect cultural variation rather than true insecurity, however (van Ijzendoorn & Sagi, 1999). Overall, secure attachment is the most common type of attachment seen in every culture studied thus far (Thompson, 2006).

### Next Step

Now move ahead to the next lesson.

### Lesson 12: Introduction

In this lesson, you will explore the concepts of gender, gender identity, sex, and sexuality. You will also learn how the characteristics of gender vary greatly across different societies and how children learn about gender roles through the gender socialization process. Socialization also enables children to learn about regulating emotions and how it helps form or strengthen relationships. 

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Describe examples of cultural practices and perspectives influencing behavior during early childhood.

### Sex, Gender, and Sexuality

When filling out official documents, you are often asked to provide your name, birth date, and sex or gender. But have you ever been asked to provide your sex *and* your gender? It may not have occurred to you that sex and gender are not the same. However, sociologists and most other social scientists view sex and gender as conceptually distinct.   
  
"Sex" denotes biological characteristics and exists along a spectrum from male to female. Gender, on the other hand, denotes social and cultural characteristics that are assigned to different sexes. Sex and gender are not always synchronous, meaning they do not always line up in an easy-to-categorize way.

#### Sex

Sex refers to physiological differences found among male, female, and various intersex bodies. Sex includes both primary sex characteristics (those related to the reproductive system) and secondary sex characteristics (those that are not directly related to the reproductive system, such as breasts and facial hair). In humans, the biological sex of a child is determined at birth based on several factors, including chromosomes, gonads, hormones, internal reproductive anatomy, and genitalia.

Biological sex has traditionally been conceptualized as a binary in Western medicine, typically divided into male and female. However, anywhere from 1.0 to 1.7 percent of children are born intersex, having a variation in sex characteristics (including chromosomes, gonads, or genitals) that do not allow them to be distinctly identified as male or female. Due to the existence of multiple forms of intersex conditions (which are more prevalent than researchers once thought), many view sex as existing along a spectrum, rather than simply two mutually exclusive categories.

In humans, sex is typically divided into male, female, or intersex (that is, having some combination of male and female sex characteristics). The symbols in the image represent female on the left and male on the right.

### Gender Identity

A person's sex, as determined by biology, does not always correspond with the individual's gender; therefore, the terms *sex* and *gender* are not interchangeable. *Gender* is a term that refers to social or cultural distinctions associated with being male, female, or intersex. Typically, babies born with male sex characteristics (sex) are assigned as boys (gender); babies born with female sex characteristics (sex) are assigned as girls (gender).   
  
Because society operates in a binary system when it comes to gender (in other words, seeing gender as only having two options), many children who are born intersex are forcibly assigned as either a boy or a girl and even surgically "corrected" to fit a particular gender. Scholars generally regard gender as a social construct—meaning that it does not exist naturally, but is instead a concept that is created by cultural and societal norms.

Gender identity is a person's sense of self as a member of a particular gender. Individuals who identify with a role that corresponds to the sex assigned to them at birth (for example, they were born with male sex characteristics, were assigned as boys, and identify today as boys or men) are cisgender.   
  
Those who identify with a role that is different from their biological sex (for example, they were born with male sex characteristics, were assigned as boys, but identify today as girls, women, or some other gender altogether) are often referred to as transgender. The term "transgender" encompasses a wide range of possible identities, including agender, genderfluid, genderqueer, two-spirit (for many indigenous people), androgynous, and many others.

#### Cultural Variations of Gender

Since the term *sex* refers to biological or physical distinctions, characteristics of sex will not vary significantly between different human societies. For example, persons of the female sex, in general, regardless of culture, will eventually menstruate and develop breasts that can lactate. Characteristics of gender, on the other hand, may vary greatly between different societies.   
  
For example, in American culture, it is considered feminine (or a trait of the female gender) to wear a dress or skirt. However, in many Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures, dresses or skirts (often referred to as sarongs, robes, or gowns) can be considered masculine. Similarly, the kilt worn by a Scottish male does not make him appear feminine in his culture.

### Sexuality

*Human sexuality* refers to people's sexual interest in and attraction to others, as well as their capacity to have erotic experiences and responses. People's sexual orientation is their emotional and sexual attraction to particular sexes or genders, which often shapes their sexuality. Sexuality may be experienced and expressed in a variety of ways, including thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviors, practices, roles, and relationships. These may manifest themselves in biological, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual aspects.

The biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely concern the human reproductive functions, including the human sexual-response cycle and the basic biological drive that exists in all species. Emotional aspects of sexuality include bonds between individuals that are expressed through profound feelings or physical manifestations of love, trust, and care. Social aspects deal with the effects of human society on one's sexuality, while spirituality concerns an individual's spiritual connection with others through sexuality. Sexuality also impacts and is impacted by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and religious aspects of life.

### The Standard Model of the Terms

The terms *sex* and *gender* have not always been differentiated in the English language, and it was not until the 1950s that they formally began to be distinguished. In an effort to clarify usage of the terms *sex* and *gender*, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a 1994 briefing, "The word 'gender' has acquired the new and useful connotation of cultural or attitudinal characteristics (as opposed to physical characteristics) distinctive to the sexes. That is to say, gender is to sex as feminine is to female and masculine is to male" (J.E.B. v. Alabama, 144 S. Ct. 1436 [1994]).

### Gender as a Social Construct

*Sex* refers to physical or physiological differences between males, females, and intersex persons, including both their primary and secondary sex characteristics. *Gender*, on the other hand, refers to social or cultural distinctions associated with a given sex. When babies are born, they are assigned a gender based on their biological sex—male babies are assigned as boys, female babies are assigned as girls, and intersex babies are usually relegated into one category or another.   
  
Scholars generally regard gender as a social construct, meaning that it does not exist naturally but is instead a concept that is created by cultural and societal norms. From birth, children are socialized to conform to certain gender roles based on their biological sex and the gender to which they are assigned. 

#### Gender Roles

As people grow, they learn how to behave from those around them. In this socialization process, children are introduced to certain roles that are typically linked to their biological sex. The term *gender role* refers to society's concept of how men and women are expected to act and behave.   
  
Gender roles are based on norms, or standards, created by society. In American culture, masculine roles have traditionally been associated with strength, aggression, and dominance, while feminine roles have traditionally been associated with passivity, nurturing, and subordination. This photo shows an old societal concept of how American men and women were expected to act.

### Gender Socialization

The socialization process in which children learn these gender roles begins at birth. Today, society is quick to outfit male infants in blue and girls in pink, even applying these color-coded gender labels while a baby is in the womb. It is interesting to note that these color associations with gender have not always been what they are today. Up until the beginning of the twentieth century, pink was actually more associated with boys, while blue was more associated with girls—illustrating how socially constructed these associations really are. 

Gender socialization occurs through four major agents: family, education, peer groups, and mass media. Each agent reinforces gender roles by creating and maintaining normative expectations for gender-specific behavior. Exposure also occurs through secondary agents, such as religion and the workplace. Repeated exposure to these agents over time leads people into a false sense that they are acting naturally based on their gender, rather than following a socially constructed role.

Children learn at a young age that there are distinct expectations for them based on their assigned gender. Cross-cultural studies reveal that children are aware of gender roles by age two or three; at four or five, most children are firmly entrenched in culturally appropriate gender roles (Kane, 1996). Parents often supply male children with trucks, toy guns, and superhero paraphernalia, which are active toys that promote motor skills, aggression, and solitary play.

Female children are often given dolls and dress-up apparel that foster nurturing, social proximity, and role play. Studies have shown that children will most likely choose to play with "gender appropriate" toys even when cross-gender toys are available, because parents give children positive feedback (in the form of praise, involvement, and physical closeness) for gender-normative behavior (Caldera et al., 1998).

The drive to adhere to masculine and feminine gender roles continues later in life. Men tend to outnumber women in professions such as law enforcement, the military, and politics; women tend to outnumber men in care-related occupations such as childcare, healthcare, and social work. These occupational roles are examples of typical American male and female behavior, derived not from biology or genetics but from our culture's traditions. Adherence to these roles demonstrates fulfillment of social expectations but not necessarily personal preference (Diamond, 2002). 

#### Sexism and Gender-Role Enforcement

The attitudes and expectations surrounding gender roles are not typically based on any inherent or natural gender differences, but on **gender stereotypes**, or oversimplified notions about the attitudes, traits, and behavior patterns of males and females. Gender stereotypes form the basis of sexism, or the prejudiced beliefs that value males over females. Common forms of sexism in modern society include gender-role expectations, such as expecting women to be the caretakers of the household.

Sexism also includes people’s expectations of how members of a gender group should behave. For example, women are expected to be friendly, passive, and nurturing; when a woman behaves in an unfriendly or assertive manner, she may be disliked or perceived as aggressive because she has violated a gender role (Rudman, 1998). In contrast, a man behaving in a similarly unfriendly or assertive way might be perceived as strong or even gain respect in some circumstances. 

Sexism can exist on a societal level such as in hiring, employment opportunities, and education. In the United States, women are less likely to be hired or promoted in male-dominated professions such as engineering, aviation, and construction (Blau et al., 2010; Ceci & Williams, 2011). In many areas of the world, young girls are not given the same access to nutrition, healthcare, and education as boys. 

### Gender Stereotypes in Society

Gender roles shape individual behavior not only by dictating how people of each gender should behave, but also by giving rise to penalties for people who do not conform to the norms. While it is somewhat acceptable for women to take on a narrow range of masculine characteristics without repercussions (such as dressing in traditionally male clothing), men are rarely able to take on more feminine characteristics (such as wearing skirts) without the risk of harassment or violence.

This threat of punishment for stepping outside of gender norms is especially true for those who do not identify as male or female. Transgender, genderqueer, and other gender-nonconforming people face discrimination, oppression, and violence for not adhering to society's traditional gender roles. People who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or queer are also ostracized for breaking the traditional gender norm of who a person of a given sex "should" be attracted to. Even people who identify as cisgender (identifying with the sex they were assigned at birth) and straight (attracted to the opposite sex) face repercussions if they step outside of their gender role in an obvious way.

### Emotional Self-Regulation and Relationships

Emotional development is essentially the way emotions change or remain constant across the human life span. Social development is the way in which humans learn to interact with one another. Together, the development of both of these factors reflects the changes in a child's emotions and relationships with others that occur throughout childhood.

#### Emotional Self-Regulation

During a child's life, they go from looking at emotions from an external point of view to an internal point of view. As children develop advanced language skills, they develop the ability to regulate emotions. Emotional self-regulation refers to children's ability to monitor, evaluate, and modify their emotional reactions in any given situation. It is a skill that develops over time and involves both responding to situations with emotions that are socially acceptable and developing the ability to withhold emotions or delay spontaneous reactions when necessary.   
  
A child's temperament has a large impact on emotional self-regulation: children who are more negatively focused tend to have a more difficult time with regulation than those who are focused on the positive aspects of life.

#### Empathy

The development of **empathy** is a crucial part of emotional and social development in childhood. The ability to identify with the feelings of another person helps in the development of prosocial (socially positive) and altruistic (helpful, beneficent, or unselfish) behavior. Altruistic behavior occurs when a person does something in order to benefit another person without expecting anything in return. Empathy helps a child develop positive peer relationships; it is affected by a child's temperament, as well as by parenting style. Children raised in loving homes with affectionate parents are more likely to develop a sense of empathy and altruism, whereas those raised in harsh or neglectful homes tend to be more aggressive and less kind to others.

#### Developing Relationships

Play is one way in which children develop relationships with others. Several types of play exist, and each type builds upon the last in a three-step process. Non-social or solitary play occurs at the beginning of childhood when children spend most time alone with preferred playthings. It then shifts to parallel play, when children begin to take an interest in other children but prefer to play alone and side-by-side.   
  
Children engaged in parallel play will sit next to one another during a play session, but each will engage in their own activity. Finally, there is associative and cooperative play in which children begin to engage with one another, exchanging and sharing toys and creating games together.

Associative and cooperative play occurs when children learn to engage with one another, such as exchanging and sharing toys and creating games together. This photo shows children at play.

### Intersubjectivity and Theory of Mind

**Intersubjectivity** refers to the psychological relationship between people; in child development, it refers to the shared, reciprocal bond between caregivers and newborn infants. Research suggests that as babies, humans are biologically wired to coordinate their actions with others; this ability to sync with others facilitates cognitive and emotional learning through social interaction.

Additionally, the most socially productive relationship between children and adults is bidirectional, where both parties actively define a shared culture. Emphasis is placed on the idea that children are actively involved in how they learn, using intersubjectivity.

### Influences on Child Development

Child development refers to the biological, psychological, and emotional changes that occur in humans between birth and the end of adolescence, as the individual progresses from dependency to increasing autonomy. Culture plays an important role in influencing this development, and what is considered "normal" development varies greatly from one culture to the next. The society and culture in which one grows up influence everything from developmental milestones and parenting styles to what kinds of hardship one is more likely to face.

#### Developmental Milestones

The normative approach to development examines the question "What is normal development?" In the early decades of the 20th century, normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine the average ages at which most children reach specific physical, cognitive, and psychosocial milestones in development (Gesell, 1933, 1939, 1940; Gesell & Ilg, 1946; Hall, 1904).   
  
Not all of the milestones were universal, meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures. Biological milestones such as puberty tend to be universal, while social milestones, such as the age at which children begin formal schooling or individuate from their parents, can differ greatly across cultures (Gesell & Ilg, 1946). 

#### Parenting Styles

Effective parenting styles also vary as a function of culture. While the authoritative parenting style (characterized by the parent giving reasonable demands, setting consistent limits, expressing warmth and affection, and listening to the child’s point of view) is the style that is most encouraged in modern American society, this is not necessarily the case in other cultures.   
  
American children raised by authoritative parents tend to have high self-esteem and social skills. In contrast, authoritarian parenting (characterized by parents placing high value on conformity and obedience, tightly monitoring their children, and expressing less warmth) is seen as more beneficial in other cultures. For instance, first-generation Chinese American children raised by authoritarian parents did just as well in school as their peers who were raised by authoritative parents (Russell et al., 2010). Different parenting styles influence children differently depending on the prevalent cultural norms and standards.

This section addresses the period of life that includes middle childhood—from about age six—through adolescence. The three main aspects of human identity—physical development, cognitive development, and psychosocial development—are central to this section, which covers two competencies in 12 lessons:

- Lesson 1: Physical Growth in Middle Childhood
- Lesson 2: Physical Growth in Adolescence for Girls
- Lesson 3: Physical Growth in Adolescence for Boys
- Lesson 4: Physical Growth in Later Adolescence
- Lesson 5: Cognitive Development in Middle Childhood
- Lesson 6: Cognitive Development in Puberty 
- Lesson 7: Cognitive Development in Adolescence
- Lesson 8: Psychosocial Development in Middle Childhood
- Lesson 9: Psychosocial Development in Puberty
- Lesson 10: Psychosocial Development in Adolescence 
- Lesson 11: Emotional Development in Middle Childhood and Adolescence
- Lesson 12: Emotions and Psychosocial Development in Middle Childhood and Adolescence

### Build Employability Skills and Competence

The skills addressed in this section are valuable for all adults, and particularly so for anyone in or aspiring to a career in the health professions. These skills are: 

1. Identify expected growth and changes at all physical, cognitive, and psychosocial stages of development. 
2. Describe the impact emotional states have on one's physiological state, behavior, and attitudes.

In this section, you can demonstrate these skills by passing a final assessment that measures whether you have mastered the following competencies:

- Explain physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development from middle childhood through adolescence.
- Explain the influence of emotions on psychosocial development and behavior from middle childhood through adolescence.

### Prepare for the Assessment

To prepare for the competency objective assessment, ask yourself these questions:

- Can I identify the milestones in physical growth and development from middle childhood through adolescence?
- Can I identify the milestones in cognitive development during middle childhood through adolescence?
- Can I identify the milestones in psychosocial development during middle childhood through adolescence?
- Can I describe how emotions influence psychosocial development and behavior from middle childhood through adolescence?

### Move Ahead if Ready

Are you ready to demonstrate your competency and skills? 

If you answered yes to all the Prepare for the Assessment questions, begin this section by taking the Section 2 assessment. If you do well and are confident, take the Pre-Assessment. Use your results, or results from a prior pre-assessment attempt, to help gauge your readiness to take the objective assessment. If you plan to move ahead, discuss your plan with your instructor.

### Lesson 1: Introduction

This lesson begins by explaining how children in middle childhood go through enormous changes in brain development and growth. During this stage of development, children's bodies are not only growing, but they are also becoming more coordinated and physically capable, although the problem of obesity can undermine functioning. It is critical to understand typical development in order to identify and assist children who are suffering from health issues. 

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in physical growth and development during middle childhood.

### Middle and Late Childhood 

The ages of six to the onset of puberty make up middle and late childhood, and much of what children experience at this age is connected to their involvement in the early grades of school. Now, the world focuses on learning and testing new skills—academic and otherwise. It is also a time to assess abilities and accomplishments by making comparisons between oneself and others.

### Adolescence 

The true end of childhood is adolescence, a period of dramatic physical change marked by an overall growth spurt and sexual maturation, known as **puberty**. It is also a time of cognitive change as the adolescent begins to think of new possibilities and to consider abstract concepts such as love, fear, and freedom.

### Overall Physical Growth and Brain Growth

#### Overall Physical Growth

Rates of growth generally slow during these years. Typically, a child will gain about five to seven pounds a year and grow about two to three inches per year (CDC, 2000). Children also tend to slim down and gain muscle strength and lung capacity, making it possible to engage in strenuous physical activity for long periods of time. The beginning of the growth spurt, which occurs prior to puberty, begins two years earlier for females than males. The mean age for the beginning of the growth spurt for girls is 9, while for boys it is 11.  
  
Children of this age tend to sharpen their abilities to perform both gross motor skills such as riding a bike, and fine motor skills such as cutting their fingernails. In gross motor skills (involving large muscles) boys typically outperform girls, while with fine motor skills (small muscles), girls outperform the boys. These improvements in motor skills are related to brain growth and experience during this developmental period.

#### Brain Growth

Two major brain growth spurts occur during middle to late childhood (Spreen et al., 1995). Between ages six and eight, significant improvements in fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination are noted. Then between 10 and 12 years of age, the frontal lobes become more developed and improvements in logic, planning, and memory are evident (van der Molen & Molenaar, 1994).   
  
**Myelination** is one factor responsible for these growths. From age 6 to 12, the nerve cells in the association areas of the brain—that is, those areas where sensory, motor, and intellectual functioning connect—become almost completely myelinated (Johnson, 2005). This myelination contributes to increases in information processing speed and the child’s reaction time.   
  
The hippocampus, responsible for transferring information from the short-term to long-term memory, also shows increases in myelination resulting in improvements in memory functioning (Rolls, 2000). Children in middle to late childhood are also better able to plan, coordinate activity using both left and right hemispheres of the brain, and to control emotional outbursts. Attention is also improved as the prefrontal cortex matures (Markant & Thomas, 2013).

### Child Obesity: Causes and Effects

The decreased participation in school physical education and youth sports is just one of many factors that has led to an increase in children being **overweight** or **obese**. The current measurement for determining excess weight is the **body mass index (BMI)**, which expresses the relationship of height to weight. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), children whose BMI is at or above the 85th percentile for their age are considered overweight, while children who are at or above the 95th percentile are considered obese (Lu, 2016).   
  
In 2015–16, approximately 13.9 percent of two- to five-year-olds and 18.4 percent of six- to 11-year-olds were obese (Hales et al., 2017). Excess weight and obesity in children are associated with a variety of medical and cognitive conditions including high blood pressure, insulin resistance, inflammation, depression, and lower academic achievement (Lu, 2016).

Being overweight has also been linked to impaired brain functioning, which includes deficits in executive functioning, working memory, mental flexibility, and decision-making (Liang et al., 2014). Children who ate more saturated fats performed worse on memory tasks; it was shown that eating a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids promoted memory skills (Davidson, 2014). Using animal studies, Davidson et al. (2013) found that large amounts of processed sugars and saturated fat weakened the blood-brain barrier, especially in the hippocampus.   
  
This can make the brain more vulnerable to harmful substances that can impair its functioning. Another important executive functioning skill is controlling impulses and delaying gratification. Children who are overweight show less inhibitory control than normal weight children, which may make it more difficult for them to avoid **unhealthy foods** (Lu, 2016). Overall, being overweight as a child increases the risk for cognitive decline as one ages.

### Problem of Recognition of Being Overweight

A growing concern is the lack of recognition by parents that children are overweight or obese. Katz (2015) referred to this as "oblivobesity"; that is, being oblivious of obesity. Black, Park, and Gregson (2015) found that parents in the United Kingdom recognized their children as obese only when they were above the 99.7th percentile; the official starting point for obesity is at the 85th percentile.

Oude Luttikhuis, Stolk, and Sauer (2010) surveyed 439 parents and found that 75 percent of parents of overweight children and 50 percent of parents of obese children said their child had a normal weight. For these parents, being overweight was considered normal and obesity was considered normal or just a little heavy. Doolen, Alpert, and Miller (2009) reported on several studies from the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, and the United States, and in all locations, parents were more likely to misperceive their children’s weight.

Black et al. (2015) concluded that as the average weight of children rises, the weight that parents consider "normal" also rises. Needless to say, if parents cannot identify if their children are overweight, they will not be able to intervene and assist them with proper weight management.

An added concern is that children do not accurately identify themselves as overweight. In a United States sample of 8- to 15-year-olds, more than 80 percent of overweight boys and 70 percent of overweight girls misperceived their weight as normal (Sarafrazi et al., 2014). Also, as the socioeconomic status of the children rose, the frequency of these misconceptions decreased. It appeared that families with more resources were more conscious of what defines a healthy weight.

Children who are overweight tend to be rejected, ridiculed, teased, and bullied by others (Stopbullying.gov, 2018). This can certainly be damaging to their self-esteem and confidence. In addition, obese children run the risk of suffering orthopedic problems such as knee injuries, and they have an increased risk of heart disease and stroke in adulthood (Lu, 2016). It is hard for a child who is obese to become a non-obese adult. In addition, the number of cases of pediatric diabetes has risen dramatically in recent years.

### Clinical Practice Guidelines to Treat Obesity

**Behavioral interventions**, including training children to overcome impulsive behavior, are being researched to help overweight children (Lu, 2016). Practicing inhibition has been shown to strengthen the ability to resist unhealthy foods. Parents can help their overweight children the best when they are warm and supportive without using shame or guilt. Parents can also act like the child’s frontal lobe until it is developed by helping them make correct food choices and praising their efforts (Liang et al., 2014).

Research also shows that exercise—especially aerobic exercise—can help improve cognitive functioning in overweight children (Lu, 2016). Parents should take caution against emphasizing diet alone to avoid the development of any obsession about dieting that can lead to eating disorders. Instead, increasing a child's activity level is most helpful.

In 2018, the American Psychological Association (APA) developed a clinical practice guideline that recommends family-based, multicomponent behavioral interventions to treat obesity and overweight in children aged 2 to 18 years (Weir, 2019). The guidelines recommend counseling on diet, physical activity, and “teaching parents strategies for goal setting, problem-solving, monitoring children’s behaviors, and modeling positive parental behaviors,” (Weir, 2019).

Early research results have shown success using this model, compared to controls that did not use it. Because there is no quick fix for weight loss, the program recommends 26 contact-hours with the family. Unfortunately, for many families, cost, location, and time commitment make it difficult for them to receive the interventions. The APA has recommended that behavioral treatment could be delivered in primary care doctors' offices to encourage greater participation. The APA also recommends that schools and communities offer more nutritious meals to children and limit sodas and unhealthy foods.

### Lesson 2: Introduction

The period that starts with puberty and ends with the transition to adulthood is known as adolescence. There are several physical changes in girls during puberty triggered by hormones. The transitions appear at different rates in distinct parts of the brain.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in physical growth and development from puberty through early adolescence for girls.

### Puberty

Puberty is a period of rapid growth and sexual maturation. These changes begin sometime between eight and fourteen. Girls begin puberty at around ten years of age, and boys begin approximately two years later. Pubertal changes take around three to four years to complete. Adolescents experience an overall physical growth spurt. The growth proceeds from the extremities toward the torso. This is referred to as **distalproximal development**. First, the hands grow, then the arms, and finally the torso.   
  
The overall physical growth spurt results in 10 to 11 inches of added height and 50 to 75 pounds of increased weight. The head begins to grow sometime after the feet have gone through their period of growth. Growth of the head is preceded by growth of the ears, nose, and lips. The difference in these patterns of growth results in adolescents appearing awkward and out-of-proportion. As the torso grows, so do the internal organs. The heart and lungs experience dramatic growth during this period.

### Physical Differences During Adolescence

During childhood, boys and girls are quite similar in height and weight. However, physical differences become apparent during adolescence. From approximately ages 10 to 14, the average girl is taller but not heavier than the average boy. After that, the average boy becomes both taller and heavier, although individual differences are certainly noted. As adolescents physically mature, weight differences are more noteworthy than height differences. At 18 years of age, those that are heaviest weigh almost twice as much as the lightest, but the tallest teens are only about 10 percent taller than the shortest (Seifert, 2012).

### Issues for Teenagers during Adolescence

Both height and weight can certainly be sensitive issues for some teenagers. Most modern societies, and the teenagers in them, tend to favor relatively short women and tall men, as well as a somewhat thin body build, especially for girls and women. Yet, neither socially preferred height nor thinness is the destiny for many individuals. Being overweight, in particular, has become a common, serious problem in modern society due to the prevalence of diets high in fat and lifestyles low in activity (Tartamella, Herscher, & Woolston, 2004). The educational system has, unfortunately, contributed to the problem as well by gradually restricting the number of physical education courses and classes in the past two decades.

#### Ethnic Background

Average height and weight are also related somewhat to racial and ethnic background. In general, children of Asian background tend to be slightly shorter than children of European and North American backgrounds. The latter, in turn, tend to be shorter than children from African societies (Eveleth & Tanner, 1990). Body shape differs slightly as well, though the differences are not always visible until after puberty. Asian background youth tend to have arms and legs that are a bit short relative to their torsos, and African background youth tend to have relatively long arms and legs. The differences are only averages, as there are large individual differences as well.

### Sexual Changes

Typically, the growth spurt is followed by the development of sexual maturity. Sexual changes are divided into two categories: Primary sexual characteristics and secondary sexual characteristics. Primary sexual characteristics are changes in the reproductive organs. For females, primary characteristics include growth of the uterus and **menarche** or the first menstrual period.   
  
The female gametes, which are stored in the ovaries, are present at birth but are immature. Each ovary contains about 400,000 gametes, but only 500 will become mature eggs (Crooks & Baur, 2007). Beginning at puberty, one ovum ripens and is released about every 28 days during the menstrual cycle. Stress and a higher percentage of body fat can bring menstruation at younger ages.

### Female Anatomy

Female external genitalia are collectively known as the vulva, which includes the **mons veneris**, **labia majora**, **labia minora**, **clitoris**, **vaginal opening**, and **urethral opening**. Female internal reproductive organs consist of the **vagina**, **uterus**, **fallopian tubes**, and **ovaries**. The uterus hosts the developing fetus, produces vaginal and uterine secretions, and passes the male's sperm through to the fallopian tubes while the ovaries release the eggs.   
  
A female is born with all her eggs already produced. The vagina is attached to the uterus through the cervix, while the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the fallopian tubes. Females have a monthly reproductive cycle; at certain intervals the ovaries release an egg, which passes through the fallopian tube into the uterus. If, in this transit, it meets with sperm, the sperm might penetrate and merge with the egg, fertilizing it. If not fertilized, the egg is flushed out of the system through menstruation.

### Secondary sexual characteristics

Secondary sexual characteristics are visible physical changes not directly linked to reproduction but signal sexual maturity. For females, breast development occurs around age 10, although full development takes several years. Hips broaden, pubic and underarm hair develops, and this hair also becomes darker and coarser.

For females, breast development occurs around age 10, although full development takes several years. Hips broaden, pubic and underarm hair develops, and this hair also becomes darker and coarser.

### Effects of Pubertal Age

The age of puberty is getting younger for children throughout the world. According to Euling et al. (2008) data are sufficient to suggest a trend toward an earlier breast development onset and menarche in girls. A century ago, the average age of a girl’s first period in the United States and Europe was 16, while today it is around 13. Because there is no clear marker of puberty for boys, it is harder to determine if boys are maturing earlier too. In addition to better nutrition, less positive reasons associated with early puberty for girls include increased stress, obesity, and **endocrine**-disrupting chemicals.

Cultural differences are noted with Asian-American girls, on average, developing last, while African American girls enter puberty the earliest. Hispanic girls start puberty the second earliest, while European American girls rank third in their age of starting puberty. Although African American girls are typically the first to develop, they are less likely to experience negative consequences of early puberty when compared to European American girls (Weir, 2016).

Research has demonstrated mental health problems linked to children who begin puberty earlier than their peers. For girls, early puberty is associated with depression, substance use, eating disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, and early sexual behavior (Graber, 2013). Early maturing girls demonstrate more anxiety and less confidence in their relationships with family and friends, and they compare themselves more negatively to their peers (Weir, 2016). 

Problems with early puberty seem to be due to the mismatch between the child’s appearance and the way she acts and thinks. Adults especially may assume the child is more capable than she actually is, and parents might grant more freedom than the child’s age would indicate. For girls, the emphasis on physical attractiveness and sexuality is emphasized at puberty and they may lack effective coping strategies to deal with the attention they may receive.

### Preadolescence

Additionally, mental health problems are more likely to occur when the child is among the first in their peer group to develop. Because **preadolescence **is a time of not wanting to appear different from others, early developing children stand out among their peer group and gravitate toward those who are older. For girls, this results in them interacting with older peers who engage in risky behaviors such as substance use and early sexual behavior (Weir, 2016).

### Lesson 3: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about the physical growth and development that occur in boys during adolescence. 

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in physical growth and development from puberty through early adolescence for boys.

### Sexual Development

Typically, the growth spurt of adolescence is followed by development of sexual maturity. Sexual changes include changes in both **primary sexual characteristics **and **secondary sexual characteristics**. Primary sexual characteristics are changes in the reproductive organs. For males, this includes growth of the **testes**, **penis**, **scrotum,** and the experience of **spermarche **(first ejaculation of **semen**). This occurs between 11 and 15 years of age. 

#### Male Anatomy: Primary Sexual Characteristics

Males have both internal and external genitalia that are responsible for procreation and sexual intercourse. Males produce their **sperm** on a cycle, and unlike the female's ovulation cycle, the male sperm production cycle is constantly producing millions of sperm daily. The main male sex organs are the penis and the testicles, the latter of which produce semen and sperm. The semen and sperm, as a result of sexual intercourse, can fertilize an **ovum** in the female's body; the fertilized ovum (zygote) develops into a fetus which is later born as a child.

#### Secondary Sexual Characteristics

**Secondary sexual characteristics** are visible physical changes not directly linked to reproduction but signal sexual maturity. For males, this includes broader shoulders and a lower voice as the larynx grows. Hair becomes coarser and darker, and hair growth occurs in the pubic area, under the arms, and on the face.

### Acne

An unpleasant consequence of the hormonal changes in puberty is **acne,** defined as pimples on the skin due to overactive sebaceous (oil-producing) glands (Dolgin, 2011). These glands develop at a greater speed than the skin ducts that discharge the oil. Consequently, the ducts can become blocked with dead skin and acne will develop.   
  
According to the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center (2000), approximately 85 percent of adolescents develop acne, and boys develop acne more than girls because of greater levels of testosterone in their systems (Dolgin, 2011). Experiencing acne can lead the adolescent to withdraw socially, especially if they are self-conscious about their skin or teased (Goodman, 2006).

Boys also see changes in their emotional functioning at puberty. According to Mendle, Harden, Brooks-Gunn, and Graber (2010), while most boys experienced a decrease in depressive symptoms during puberty, boys who began puberty earlier and exhibited a fast rate of change actually showed an increase in depressive symptoms. The effects of pubertal tempo (rate of change) were stronger than those of pubertal timing (age of change), suggesting that rapid pubertal change in boys may be a more important risk factor than the timing of development.   
  
In a further study to better analyze the reasons for this change, Mendle, Harden, Brooks-Gunn and Graber (2012) found that both early maturing boys and rapidly maturing boys displayed decrements in the quality of their peer relationships as they moved into early adolescence, whereas boys with more typical timing and tempo development actually experienced improvements in peer relationships. Researchers concluded that the transition in peer relationships may be especially challenging for boys whose pubertal maturation differs significantly from those of others their age. Consequences for boys attaining early puberty were increased odds of cigarette, alcohol, or another drug use (Dudovitz, et al., 2015).

### Key Term

- **acne:** a skin condition common in adolescence in which the sebaceous glands are clogged and inflamed

### Gender Role Intensification

At about the same time that puberty accentuates gender, role differences also become more important, for at least some teenagers. Some girls who excelled at math or science in elementary school may curb their enthusiasm and displays of success at these subjects for fear of limiting their popularity or attractiveness as girls (Taylor, Gilligan, & Sullivan, 1995; Sadker, 2004). Some boys who were not especially interested in sports previously may begin dedicating themselves to athletics to affirm their masculinity in the eyes of others.   
  
Some boys and girls who once worked together successfully on class projects may no longer feel comfortable doing so, or alternatively may now seek to be working partners, but for social rather than academic reasons. Such changes do not affect all youngsters equally, and nor do they affect any one youngster equally on all occasions. An individual may act like a young adult on one day, but more like a child the next.

### Lesson 4: Introduction

This lesson examines the major stages of growth and development in late adolescence, as well as primary and secondary sex traits. You will see how teenagers' physical growth varies greatly by individuals and how physical development can be a source of both pride and embarrassment.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in physical growth and development during later adolescence.

### Adolescence

Adolescence is a socially constructed concept. In pre-industrial society, children were considered adults when they reached physical maturity; however, today, there is an extended time between childhood and adulthood known as adolescence. Adolescence is the period of development that begins at **puberty** and ends at emerging adulthood; the typical age range is from 12 to 18 years of age, and this stage of development has some predictable physical milestones.

### Physical Changes of Puberty

Puberty is the period of several years in which rapid physical growth and psychological changes occur, culminating in sexual maturity. The onset of puberty typically occurs at age 10 or 11 for females and at age 11 or 12 for males; females usually complete puberty by ages 15 to 17, while males usually finish around ages 16 to 17. Females tend to attain reproductive maturity about four years after the first physical changes of puberty appear. Males, however, accelerate more slowly but continue to grow for about six years after the first visible pubertal changes.

While the sequence of physical changes in puberty is predictable, the onset and pace of puberty vary widely. Every person's individual timetable for puberty is different and is primarily influenced by heredity; however, environmental factors—such as diet and exercise—also exert some influence. 

#### Hormonal Changes

Puberty involves distinctive physiological changes in an individual's height, weight, body composition, and circulatory and respiratory systems. During this time, both the adrenal glands and the sex glands mature—processes known as **adrenarche** and **gonadarche**, respectively. 

These changes are largely influenced by hormonal activity. Hormones play an organizational role (priming the body to behave in a certain way once puberty begins) and an activational role (triggering certain behavioral and physical changes). During puberty, the adolescent's hormonal balance shifts strongly towards an adult state; the process is triggered by the **pituitary gland**, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the bloodstream and initiates a chain reaction.

#### Sexual Maturation

It is this stage in life in which a young person develops secondary sex characteristics. Primary sex characteristics are related to organs specifically needed for reproduction, like the uterus and ovaries in females and the testes in males. Secondary sex characteristics, on the other hand, are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs. In females, this includes the development of breasts and widening of hips. In males, it includes the development of facial hair and the deepening of the voice. Both sexes experience the development of pubic and underarm hair, as well as increased development of sweat glands. 

The male and female **gonads** are activated by the surge of hormones, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries release estrogen; the production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Girls experience **menarche**, the beginning of menstrual periods, usually around 12–13 years old, and boys experience **spermarche**, the first ejaculation, around 13 to 14 years old. Facial hair in males typically appears around age 14.

#### Physical Growth

The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in an individual's height and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones, thyroid hormones, and **androgens**. Males experience their growth spurt about two years later than females. The accelerated growth in different body parts happens at different times, but for all adolescents, it has a fairly regular sequence.

The first places to grow are the extremities (head, hands, and feet), followed by the arms and legs, and later the torso and shoulders. This non-uniform growth is one reason why an adolescent body may seem out of proportion. During puberty, bones become harder and more brittle. 

Before puberty, there are almost no differences between males and females in the distribution of fat and muscle. During puberty, males grow muscle much faster than females, and females experience a higher increase in body fat. The ratio between muscle and fat in post-pubertal males is around 1:3, while for females, it is about 5:4. An adolescent's heart and lungs increase in both size and capacity during puberty; these changes contribute to increased strength and tolerance for exercise.

### Effects of Physical Development

Because rates of physical development vary so widely among teenagers, puberty can be a source of pride or embarrassment. Early maturing boys tend to be physically stronger, taller, and more athletic than their later maturing peers; this can contribute to differences in popularity among peers, which can in turn influence the teenager's confidence.   
  
Some studies show that boys who mature earlier tend to be more popular and independent but are also at a greater risk for substance abuse and early sexual activity (Flannery et al., 1993; Kaltiala-Heino et al., 2001). Early-maturing girls may face increased teasing and sexual harassment-related to their developing bodies, which can contribute to self-consciousness and place them at a higher risk for anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and **eating disorders** (Ge et al., 2001; Graber et al., 1997; Striegel-Moore & Cachelin, 1999).   
  
Girls and boys who develop more slowly than their peers may feel self-conscious about their lack of physical development; some research has found that negative feelings are particularly a problem for late maturing boys, who are at a higher risk for depression and conflict with parents (Graber et al., 1997) and more likely to be bullied (Pollack & Shuster, 2000).

### Lesson 5: Introduction

In middle and late childhood, cognitive skills continue to develop as thought processes become more rational and ordered. At this age, children grasp ideas like past, present, and future, allowing them to plan and work toward goals. They can also handle more sophisticated concepts in subjects such as math and science, as well as cause-and-effect relationships.

In this lesson, you will learn about the concrete operational stage of cognitive development during middle childhood.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in cognitive development during middle childhood.

### Piaget's Concrete Operational Stage

From ages 7 to 11, children are in what Piaget referred to as the **concrete operational stage** of cognitive development (Crain, 2005). This involves mastering the use of logic in concrete ways. The word *concrete* refers to that which is tangible; that which can be seen, touched, or experienced directly. The concrete operational child is able to make use of logical principles in solving problems involving the physical world. For example, the child can understand the principles of cause and effect, size, and distance.
[Opens in new tab](https://assets.wgu.edu/6e0d0a37a426f7d0ac67a49a849ac3cf)Image description
As children's experiences and vocabularies grow, they build schemata and are able to organize objects in many different ways. They also understand classification hierarchies and can arrange objects into a variety of classes and subclasses. This image shows and example of how children in the concrete operational stage understand how to classify organisms. From domain, kingdom, phylus, class, order, family, genus, and species.Lally, M., and Valentine-French, S. (2019). [Lifespan development: A psychological perspective, 2nd ed.Opens in new tab](http://dept.clcillinois.edu/psy/LifespanDevelopment.pdf)
#### Inductive Reasoning

The child can use logic to solve problems tied to direct experience but has trouble solving hypothetical problems or considering more abstract problems. The child uses **inductive reasoning**, which is a logical process that combines multiple premises believed to be true to obtain a specific conclusion. For example, Mark has made three friends in his new neighborhood. Simon, his first friend, can be rude. Ayla, another friend, is also rude much of the time, and so is Mark's third friend, Jamal. Mark concludes that people in this neighborhood are rude. This way of thinking tends to change during adolescence, replaced with **deductive reasoning**.

#### Classification

As children's experiences and vocabularies grow, they build schemata and are able to organize objects in many different ways. They also understand classification hierarchies and can arrange objects into a variety of classes and subclasses.

#### Identity

One feature of concrete operational thought is the understanding that objects have qualities that do not change even if the object is altered in some way. For instance, the mass of an object does not change by rearranging it. A piece of chalk is still chalk even when the piece is broken in two.

#### Reversibility

The child learns that some things that have been changed can be returned to their original state. Water can be frozen and then thawed to become liquid again, but eggs cannot be unscrambled. Arithmetic operations are reversible as well: 2 + 3 = 5 and 5 – 3 = 2. Many of these cognitive skills are incorporated into the school's curriculum through mathematical problems and in worksheets about which situations are reversible or irreversible.

#### Conservation

Preoperational children often think that a tall beaker filled with eight ounces of water is "more" than a short, wide bowl filled with eight ounces of water. Concrete operational children can understand the concept of conservation, which means that changing one quality (in this example, the height of a container) can be compensated for by changes in another quality (the width of a container). Consequently, there is the same amount of water in each container, although one is taller and narrower and the other is shorter and wider.

#### Decentration

Concrete operational children no longer focus on only one dimension of any object (such as the height of the glass) and instead consider the changes in other dimensions too (such as the width of the glass). This allows for conservation to occur.

#### Seriation

Arranging items along a quantitative dimension, such as length or weight, in a methodical way is now demonstrated by the concrete operational child. For example, the child can methodically arrange a series of different-sized sticks in order by length, while younger children approach a similar task in a haphazard way.

These new cognitive skills increase the child's understanding of the physical world; however, according to Piaget, children of this stage of cognitive development still cannot think in abstract ways. Additionally, they do not think in systematic scientific ways. For example, children of various ages are asked which variables influence the period that a pendulum takes to complete its arc; they are given weights they can attach to strings in order to do experiments to determine the answer. Most children younger than 12 years of age perform biased experiments from which no conclusions can be drawn (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958).

### Information Processing

Children differ in their memory abilities, and these differences predict both their readiness for school and academic performance in school (PreBler, Krajewski, & Hasselhorn, 2013). During middle and late childhood, children make strides in several areas of cognitive function including the capacity of working memory, their ability to pay attention, and their use of memory strategies. Both changes in the brain and experience foster these abilities.

#### Working Memory

The capacity of working memory expands during middle and late childhood, and research has suggested that both an increase in processing speed and the ability to dismiss irrelevant information contribute to the greater efficiency of working memory during this age (de Ribaupierre, 2002). Changes in myelination and synaptic pruning in the cortex are likely behind the increase in processing speed and ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli (Kail, McBride-Chang, Ferrer, Cho, & Shu, 2013).

Children with learning disabilities in math and reading often have difficulties with working memory (Alloway, 2009). They may struggle with following the directions of an assignment. When a task calls for multiple steps, children with poor working memory may miss steps because they may lose track of where they are in the task.   
  
Adults working with such children may need to communicate using more familiar vocabulary and shorter sentences, repeating task instructions more frequently, and breaking more complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Some studies have also shown that more intensive training of working memory strategies, such as chunking, aids in improving the capacity of working memory in children with poor working memory (Alloway, Bible, & Lau, 2013).

#### Attention

As noted above, the ability to dismiss irrelevant information improves during this age, with there being a sharp improvement in selective attention from age six into adolescence (Vakil, Blachstein, Sheinman, & Greenstein, 2009). Children also improve in their ability to shift their attention between tasks or among different features of a task (Carlson, Zelazo, & Faja, 2013).   
  
A younger child who is asked to sort objects into piles based on type of object—car versus animal, or red versus blue—may have difficulty if asked, midway through, to switch from sorting based on type to sorting based on color. This requires suppressing the prior sorting rule. An older child has less difficulty making the switch, meaning there is greater flexibility in attentional skills. These changes in attention and working memory contribute to children having more strategic approaches to challenging tasks.

#### Memory Strategies

Bjorklund (2005) describes a developmental progression in the acquisition and use of memory strategies. Such strategies are often lacking in younger children but increase in frequency as children progress through elementary school. Examples of memory strategies include rehearsing information needed to recall; visualizing and organizing information; creating rhymes, such as "i before e except after c"; or inventing acronyms such as "Roy G Biv" to remember the colors of the rainbow.   
  
Schneider, Kron-Sperl, and Hünnerkopf (2009) reported a steady increase in the use of memory strategies from ages 6 to 10 in their longitudinal study. Moreover, by age 10, many children were using two or more memory strategies to help them recall information. Schneider and colleagues (2009) found that there were considerable individual differences at each age in the use of strategies, and that children who used more strategies had better memory performance than peers of the same age. This table shows the general improvement in using memory strategies by children aged 6 to 10.

#### Table S2, L 5.2 Percentage of Children Who Did Not Use Any Memory Strategies, by Age
AgePercentage6557448259171013
  
Children may experience three deficiencies in their use of memory strategies:

- A **mediation deficiency** occurs when a child does not grasp the strategy being taught, and therefore does not benefit from its use. If you do not understand why using an acronym might be helpful or how to create an acronym, the strategy is not likely to help you.
- In a **production deficiency**, the child does not spontaneously use a memory strategy and must be prompted to do so. In this case, children know the strategy and are more than capable of using it, but they fail to "produce" the strategy on their own. For example, children might know how to make a list but may fail to do this to help them remember what to bring on a family vacation.
- A **utilization deficiency** refers to children using an appropriate strategy, but it fails to aid their performance. Utilization deficiency is common in the early stages of learning a new memory strategy (Schneider & Pressley, 1997; Miller, 2000).

  
Until the use of a strategy becomes automatic, it may slow down the learning process, as space is taken up in memory by the strategy itself. Initially, children may get frustrated because their memory performances may seem worse when they try to use the new strategy. Once children become more adept at using the strategy, their memory performances improve. Sodian and Schneider (1999) found that new memory strategies acquired prior to age eight often show gradual improvement in the child's use of a utilization deficiency strategy. In contrast, strategies acquired after this age often followed an "all-or-nothing" principle in which improvement was not gradual, but abrupt.

#### Knowledge Base

During middle and late childhood, children are able to learn and remember due to improvement in the ways they attend to and store information. As children enter school and learn more about the world, they develop more categories for concepts and learn more efficient strategies for storing and retrieving information. One significant reason is that they continue to have more experiences to which to tie new information. In other words, their **knowledge base**—knowledge in particular areas that makes learning new information easier—expands (Berger, 2014).

#### Metacognition

Children in middle and late childhood also have a better understanding of how well they are performing a task and the level of difficulty of the task. As they become more realistic about their abilities, they can adapt studying strategies to meet those needs. Young children spend as much time on an unimportant aspect of a problem as they do on the main point, while older children start to learn to prioritize and gauge what is significant and what is not. As a result, they develop **metacognition**. Metacognition refers to the knowledge people have about their own thinking and their ability to use this awareness to regulate cognitive processes (Bruning, Schraw, Norby, & Ronning, 2004).

#### Critical Thinking

According to Bruning et al. (2004), there is a debate in U.S. education as to whether schools should teach students *what *to think or *how *to think. Critical thinking—a detailed examination of beliefs, courses of action, and evidence—involves teaching children *how *to think. The purpose of critical thinking is to evaluate information in ways that help people make informed decisions.   
  
Critical thinking involves better understanding of a problem through gathering, evaluating, and selecting information, and also by considering many possible solutions. Ennis (1987) identified several skills useful in critical thinking. These include analyzing arguments, clarifying information, judging the credibility of a source, making value judgments, and deciding on an action. Metacognition is essential to critical thinking because it allows people to reflect on information as they make decisions.

### Language Development

#### Vocabulary

One of the reasons that older children can classify objects in so many ways is that they have acquired a **vocabulary** to do so. By fifth grade, a child's vocabulary has grown to about 40,000 words. It grows at a rate that exceeds word acquisition in early childhood. This language explosion, however, differs from that of younger children because it is facilitated by associating new words with those already known, and because it is accompanied by a more sophisticated understanding of the meanings of a word.

#### New Understanding 

Children in middle and late childhood are also able to think of objects in less literal ways. For example, if asked for the first word that comes to mind when hearing "pizza," a younger child is likely to say "eat." However, an older child is more likely to place pizza in an appropriate category: "food." This sophistication of vocabulary is also evidenced by the fact that older children tell jokes and delight in doing it. They may use jokes that involve plays on words such as "knock-knock" jokes or jokes with punchlines. Young children do not understand plays on words; their "jokes" tend toward the literal or slapstick, such as, "A man fell down in the mud! Isn't that funny?"

#### Grammar and Flexibility

Older children are also able to learn new rules of grammar with more flexibility. While younger children are likely to be reluctant to give up saying "I goed there," older children will learn the variation on the general rule of adding *-ed* to form the past tense—in this case, "I went there"—rather quickly, along with other such rules and conventions.

### Communication Disorders

#### Fluency Disorders

Fluency disorders affect the rate of speech. Speech may be labored and slow, or too fast for listeners to follow. The most common fluency disorder is **stuttering**. Stuttering is a speech disorder in which sounds, syllables, or words are repeated or last longer than normal. These problems cause a break in the flow of speech, which is called **dysfluency** (Medline Plus, 2016b). About 5 percent of young children, aged two to five, will develop some stuttering that may last from several weeks to several years (Medline Plus, 2016c). Approximately 75 percent of children recover from stuttering.

For the remaining 25 percent, stuttering can persist as a lifelong communication disorder (National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders, NIDCD, 2016). This is called developmental stuttering and is the most common form of stuttering. Brain injury and, in very rare instances, emotional trauma may be other triggers for developing problems with stuttering. In most cases of developmental stuttering, other family members share the same communication disorder. Researchers have recently identified variants in four genes that are more commonly found in those who stutter (NIDCD, 2016).

#### Articulation Disorder

An articulation disorder refers to the inability to correctly produce speech sounds (phonemes) because of imprecise placement, timing, pressure, speed, or flow of movement of the lips, tongue, or throat (NIDCD, 2016). Sounds can be substituted, left off, added, or changed. These errors may make it hard for people to understand the speaker. They can range from problems with specific sounds, such as lisping, to severe impairment in the phonological system.

Most children have problems pronouncing words early on while their speech is developing. However, by age three, at least half of what a child says should be understood by a stranger. By age five, a child's speech should be mostly intelligible. Parents should seek help if by age six the child is still having trouble producing certain sounds. It should be noted that accents are not articulation disorders (Medline Plus, 2016a).

#### Voice Disorder

Disorders of the voice involve problems with pitch, loudness, and quality of the voice (American Speech-Language and Hearing Association, 2016). It only becomes a disorder when problems with the voice make the child unintelligible. In children, voice disorders are significantly more prevalent in males than in females. Between 1.4 percent and 6 percent of children experience problems with the quality of their voices. Causes can be due to structural abnormalities in the vocal cords and/or larynx, functional factors such as vocal fatigue from overuse, and in rarer cases, psychological factors such as chronic stress and anxiety.

### Theories of Intelligence

Psychologists have long debated how to best conceptualize and measure intelligence (Sternberg, 2003). The debate includes questions like: How many types of intelligence are there? What is the role of nature versus nurture in intelligence? How is intelligence represented in the brain? and What is the meaning of group differences in intelligence?

#### General and Specific Intelligences

In 1904 and 1905, the French psychologist Alfred Binet (1857–1914) and his colleague Théodore Simon (1872–1961) began working on behalf of the French government to develop a measure that would identify children who would not be successful with the regular school curriculum. The goal was to help teachers better educate these students (Aiken, 1994).   
  
Binet and Simon developed what most psychologists today regard as the first intelligence test, which consisted of a wide variety of questions that included the ability to name objects, define words, draw pictures, complete sentences, compare items, and construct sentences. Binet and Simon (Binet, Simon, & Town, 1915; Siegler, 1992) believed that the questions they asked the children all assessed the basic abilities to understand, reason, and make judgments. It turned out that the correlations among these different types of measures were in fact all positive; that is, students who got one item correct were more likely to also get other items correct, even though the questions themselves were very different.

#### General Intelligence Factor

On the basis of these results, the psychologist Charles Spearman (1863–1945) hypothesized that there must be a single underlying construct that all of these items measure. He called the construct that the different abilities and skills measured on intelligence tests have in common the "general intelligence factor." Virtually all psychologists now believe that there is a **generalized intelligence** factor that relates to abstract thinking and includes the abilities to acquire knowledge, to reason abstractly, to adapt to novel situations, and to benefit from instruction and experience (Gottfredson, 1997; Sternberg, 2003). People with higher general intelligence learn faster.

#### Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test

Soon after Binet and Simon introduced their test, the American psychologist Lewis Terman (1877–1956) at Stanford University developed an American version of Binet’s test that became known as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test. The Stanford-Binet is a measure of general intelligence made up of a wide variety of tasks, including vocabulary, memory for pictures, naming of familiar objects, repeating sentences, and following commands.

#### Specific Intelligence

Although there is general agreement among psychologists that generalized intelligence exists, there is also evidence for **specific intelligence,** a measure of specific skills in narrow domains. One empirical result in support of the idea of****specific intelligence comes from intelligence tests themselves. Although the different types of questions do correlate with each other, some items correlate more highly with each other than other items; they form clusters or "clumps" of intelligence.

#### Triarchic Theory

One advocate of the idea of multiple intelligences is the psychologist Robert Sternberg. Sternberg proposed a **triarchic (three-part) theory of intelligence** that proposes that people may display more or less **analytical intelligence**, **creative intelligence**, and **practical intelligence**. Sternberg (1985, 2003) argued that traditional intelligence tests assess analytical intelligence, academic problem-solving, and performing calculations, but that they do not typically assess creative intelligence, the ability to adapt to new situations and create new ideas, and/or practical intelligence, the ability to demonstrate common sense and street-smarts. As Sternberg proposed, research has found that creativity is not highly correlated with analytical intelligence (Furnham & Bachtiar, 2008) and exceptionally creative scientists, artists, mathematicians, and engineers do not score higher on intelligence than their less creative peers (Simonton, 2000).

### Kinds of Thinking

On the other hand, being creative often takes some of the basic abilities measured by general intelligence, including the abilities to learn from experience, to remember information, and to think abstractly (Bink & Marsh, 2000). Ericsson (1998), Weisberg (2006), Hennessey and Amabile (2010), and Simonton (1992) studied creative people and identified at least five components that are likely to be important for creativity, as this table shows.

#### Table S2, L5.4 Important Components for Creativity
**Component ****Description **Expertise Creative people have studied and learned about a topic Imaginative ThinkingCreative people view problems in new and different ways Risk Taking Creative people take on new, but potentially risky approachesIntrinsic Interest Creative people take on projects for interest not money Working in Creative EnvironmentsThe most creative people are supported, aided, and challenged by other people working on similar projects 
####   
Street Smarts

The last aspect of the triarchic model, practical intelligence, refers primarily to intelligence that cannot be gained from books or formal learning. Practical intelligence represents a type of “street smarts” or “common sense” that is learned from life experiences. Although a number of tests have been devised to measure practical intelligence (Sternberg, Wagner, & Okagaki, 1993; Wagner & Sternberg, 1985), research has not found much evidence that practical intelligence is distinct from general intelligence or that it is predictive of success at any particular tasks (Gottfredson, 2003). Practical intelligence may include, at least in part, certain abilities that help people perform well at specific jobs, and these abilities may not always be highly correlated with general intelligence (Sternberg et al., 1993).  
  

#### Convergent and Divergent Thinking

The brain areas that are associated with **convergent thinking**, thinking that is directed toward finding the correct answer to a given problem, are different from those associated with **divergent thinking**, the ability to generate many different ideas or solutions to a single problem (Tarasova, Volf, & Razoumnikova, 2010).

### Theory of Multiple Intelligences

Another champion of the idea of specific types of intelligences rather than one overall intelligence is the psychologist Howard Gardner (1983, 1999). Gardner argued that it would be evolutionarily advantageous for different people to have different talents and skills and proposed that there are eight intelligences that can be differentiated from each other. A potential ninth intelligence ("existential") still needs empirical support.   
  
Gardner investigated intelligence by focusing on children who were talented in one or more areas and adults who suffered from strokes that compromised some capacities, but not others. Gardner also noted that some evidence for multiple intelligences comes from the abilities of autistic **savants**, people who score low on intelligence tests overall, but who nevertheless may have exceptional skills in a given domain, such as math, music, art, or memory, such as being able to recite statistics in a given sport (Treffert & Wallace, 2004).   
  
In addition to brain damage and the existence of savants, Gardner identified these eight intelligences based on other criteria including a set developmental history and psychometric findings. Here is a list of Gardner’s eight specific intelligences (1999).

#### Table S2, L5.4 Howard Gardner’s Eight Specific Intelligences
**Intelligence****Description **Linguistic The ability to speak and write well Logical-mathematicalThe ability to use logic and mathematical skills to solve problems Spatial The ability to think and reason about objects in three dimensions MusicalThe ability to perform and enjoy musicKinesthetic (body) The ability to move the body in sports, dance, or other physical activitiesInterpersonal The ability to understand and interact effectively with others  Intrapersonal The ability to have insight into the self Naturalistic The ability to recognize, identify, and understand animals, plants, and other living things 

### Idea of Multiple Intelligences

The idea of multiple intelligences has been influential in recent years in the field of education, and teachers have used these ideas to try to teach differently to different students. For instance, to teach math problems to students who have particularly good kinesthetic intelligence, a teacher might encourage students to move their bodies or hands according to the numbers.   
  
On the other hand, some have argued that these "intelligences" sometimes seem more like "abilities" or "talents" rather than real intelligence. There is no clear conclusion about how many intelligences there are. Are a sense of humor, artistic skills, dramatic skills, and so forth also separate intelligences? Furthermore—again demonstrating the underlying power of a single intelligence—are the many different "intelligences," in fact, correlated and thus simply represent, in part, general intelligence (Brody, 2003).

### Extremes of Intelligence

#### Normal Distribution

The results of studies assessing the measurement of intelligence show that "intelligence quotient" (IQ), a common term meaning general intelligence, is distributed in the population in the form of a normal distribution (or bell curve), which is the pattern of scores usually observed in a variable that clusters around its average. In a normal distribution, the bulk of scores fall toward the middle, with fewer scores falling at the extremes.

The normal distribution of intelligence shows that on IQ tests, as well as on most other measures, the majority of people cluster around the average (in this case, where IQ = 100), and fewer are either very smart or very dull. Because the standard deviation of an IQ test is about 15, about 2 percent of people score above an IQ of 130, often considered the threshold for giftedness, and about the same percentage score below an IQ of 70, often considered the threshold for an **intellectual disability**.

### Distribution of IQ Scores

Although this graph presents a single data set distribution, the actual IQ distribution varies by sex; the distribution for men is more spread out than the distribution for women. These sex differences mean that about 20 percent more men than women fall in the extreme (very smart or very dull) ends of the distribution (Johnson, Carothers, & Deary, 2009).   
  
Boys are about five times more likely to be diagnosed with the reading disability **dyslexia **than girls (Halpern, 1992), and are also more likely to be classified as having an intellectual disability. However, boys are also about 20 percent more highly represented in the upper end of the IQ distribution.

The standard deviation of an IQ test is about 15, about 2% of people score above an IQ of 130, often considered gifted. The same percentage score below an IQ of 70, often being considered the threshold for an intellectual disability.Lally, M., and Valentine-French, S. (2019).

### Intellectual Disability

One end of the distribution of intelligence scores is defined by people with very low IQ. Intellectual disability (or intellectual developmental disorder) is assessed based on cognitive capacity (in other words, IQ) and severity of the disability is based on **adaptive functioning**, or how well the person handles everyday life tasks.

About 1 percent of the U.S. population, most of them males, fulfill the criteria for intellectual developmental disorder, but some children who are given this diagnosis lose the classification as they get older and learn to function better in society. A particular vulnerability of people with low IQ is that they may be taken advantage of by others, and this is an important aspect of the definition of intellectual developmental disorder (Greenspan, Loughlin, & Black, 2001).

### Down Syndrome

One cause of intellectual developmental disorder is Down syndrome, a chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of all or part of an extra twenty-first chromosome. The incidence of Down syndrome is estimated at approximately 1 per 700 births, and the prevalence increases as the mother's age increases (CDC, 2014). People with Down syndrome typically exhibit a distinctive pattern of physical features, including a flat nose, upwardly slanted eyes, a protruding tongue, and a short neck.

Fortunately, societal attitudes toward individuals with intellectual disabilities have changed over the past decades. Laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) have made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of mental and physical disability, and there has been a trend to bring people with intellectual disabilities out of institutions and into workplaces and schools.

### Giftedness

**Giftedness **refers to children who have an IQ of 130 or higher (Lally & Valentine-French, 2015). Having extremely high IQ is clearly less of a problem than having extremely low IQ, but there may also be challenges to being particularly smart. It is often assumed that schoolchildren who are labeled as "gifted" may have adjustment problems that make it more difficult for them to create social relationships.   
  
To study gifted children, Lewis Terman and his colleagues (Terman & Oden, 1959) selected about 1,500 high school students who scored in the top 1 percent on the Stanford-Binet and similar IQ tests (that is, students who had tested IQs of about 135 or higher), and tracked them for more than seven decades. (These children became known as the "termites" and are still being studied today.) This study found that these students were not unhealthy or poorly adjusted, but rather were above average in physical health and were taller and heavier than individuals in the general population. The students also had above average social relationships and were less likely to divorce than the average person (Seagoe, 1975).

Terman's study also found that many of these students went on to achieve high levels of education and entered prestigious professions, including medicine, law, and science. Of the sample, 7 percent earned doctoral degrees, 4 percent earned medical degrees, and 6 percent earned law degrees. These numbers are all considerably higher than what would have been expected from a more general population. Another study of young adolescents who had even higher IQs found that these students ended up attending graduate school at a rate more than 50 times higher than that in the general population (Lubinski & Benbow, 2006).

As you might expect based on a discussion of intelligence, kids who are gifted have higher scores on general intelligence, but there are also different types of giftedness. Some children are particularly good at math or science, some at automobile repair or carpentry, some at music or art, some at sports or leadership, and so on. There is a lively debate among scholars about whether it is appropriate or beneficial to label some children as "gifted and talented" in school and to provide them with accelerated special classes and other programs that are not available to everyone. Although doing so may help the gifted kids (Colangelo & Assouline, 2009), it also may isolate them from their peers who are not classified as "gifted."

### Education in Middle Childhood

#### Education

The **ecological systems model** (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) helps in understanding an individual by examining the contexts in which the person lives and the direct and indirect influences of those contexts on the person's life. School becomes a very important component of children's lives during middle and late childhood, and parents and the culture contribute to children's experiences in school.

#### Gender

The stereotypes held by parents and teachers can influence children's self-efficacy (the belief that you are capable of carrying out a specific task or of reaching a specific goal) about their abilities in various domains. For example, teachers who hold the view that girls are better at reading (Retelsdorf et al., 2015) or that boys are better at math (Plante et al., 2013) often find that their students' performance in these areas mirror these stereotypes, despite the children's actual abilities, or the abilities of children in the classrooms of teachers who do not hold such stereotypes. While not all children will internalize the views of others, those who do are more likely to show declines in their performance consistent with the stereotypes (Plante et al., 2013; Retelsdorf et al., 2015).

#### Parental Involvement in School

Parents vary in their levels of involvement with their children's schools. Teachers often complain that they have difficulty getting parents to participate in their child's education and devise a variety of techniques to keep parents in touch with daily and overall progress. For example, parents may be required to sign a behavior chart each evening to be returned to school or may be given information about the school's events through websites and newsletters. There are other factors that need to be considered when looking at parental involvement. To explore these, first ask yourself if all parents who enter the school with concerns about their child will be received in the same way.

Horvat (2004) found that teachers seek a particular type of involvement from particular types of parents. While teachers thought they were open and neutral in their responses to parental involvement, in reality teachers were most receptive to support, praise, and agreement coming from parents who were most similar in race and social class with the teachers. Parents who criticized the school or its policies were less likely to be given a voice.   
  
Parents who have higher levels of income, occupational status, and other qualities favored in society have **family capital**. This is a form of power that can be used to improve a child's education. Parents who do not have these qualities may find it more difficult to be effectively involved. The authors suggest that teachers closely examine their biases against parents. Schools may also need to examine their ability to dialogue with parents about school policies in more open ways. Any efforts to improve effective parental involvement should address these concerns.

### Learning Disability

A **learning disability **(LD) is a neurological disorder that results from the way an individual human brain functions. LDs are not related to intelligence; people with LDs are as intelligent, or more intelligent, than the average. However, an LD results in a major discrepancy between a student's ability and some feature of achievement: The student may be delayed in reading, writing, listening, speaking, or doing mathematics, but not in all of these at once. 

A learning problem is not considered a learning disability if it stems from physical, sensory, or motor limitations, or from generalized intellectual impairment. It is also not an LD if the learning problem really reflects the challenges of learning English as a second language. 

Genuine LDs are the learning problems left over after these other possibilities are accounted for or excluded. Typically, a student with an LD has not been helped by teachers' ordinary efforts to assist the student when he or she falls behind academically, though what counts as an "ordinary effort," of course, differs among teachers, schools, and students. Most importantly, though, an LD relates to a fairly specific area of academic learning.   
  
A student may be able to read and compute well enough, for example, but not be able to write. LDs are by far the most common form of special educational need, accounting for half of all students with special needs in the United States and approximately 20 percent of all students, depending on how the numbers are estimated (National Center for Learning Disabilities, 2017). Students with LDs are so common, in fact, that most teachers regularly encounter at least one per class in any given school year, regardless of the grade level they teach.

These difficulties are identified in school because this is when children's academic abilities are being tested, compared, and measured. Consequently, once academic testing is no longer essential in that person's life (meaning when they are working rather than going to school), these disabilities may no longer be noticed or relevant, depending on the person's job and the extent of the disability.

#### Dyslexia

Dyslexia is one of the most commonly diagnosed disabilities and involves having difficulty in the area of reading. This diagnosis is used for a number of reading difficulties. Common characteristics are difficulty with phonological processing, which includes the manipulation of sounds, spelling, and rapid visual and verbal processing. Additionally, the child may reverse letters, have difficulty reading from left to right, or may have problems associating letters with sounds.   
  
Dyslexia appears to be rooted in neurological problems involving the parts of the brain active in recognizing letters, verbally responding, or being able to manipulate sounds. Recent studies have identified a number of genes that are linked to developing dyslexia (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2016). Treatment typically involves altering teaching methods to accommodate the person's particular problematic area.

#### Dysgraphia

**Dysgraphia **refers to a writing disability that is often associated with dyslexia (Carlson, 2013). There are different types of dysgraphia, including phonological dysgraphia when the person cannot sound out words and write them phonetically. Orthographic dysgraphia is demonstrated by those individuals who can spell regularly spelled words, but not irregularly spelled ones. Some individuals with dysgraphia experience difficulties in motor control and experience trouble forming letters when using a pen or pencil.

#### Dyscalculia

**Dyscalculia **refers to problems in math. Cowan and Powell (2014) identified several terms used when describing difficulties in mathematics including dyscalculia, mathematical learning disability, and mathematics disorder. All three terms refer to students with average intelligence who exhibit poor academic performance in mathematics. When evaluating a group of third graders, Cowan and Powell (2014) found that children with dyscalculia demonstrated problems with working memory, reasoning, processing speed, and oral language, all of which are referred to as domain-general factors. Additionally, problems with multi-digit skills, including number system knowledge, were also exhibited.

#### Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

A child with **att****ention-deficit/hyperactivity**** disorder (ADHD) **shows a constant pattern of inattention and/or hyperactive and impulsive behavior that interferes with normal functioning (American Psychological Association [APA], 2013). Some of the signs of inattention include great difficulty with, and avoidance of, tasks that require sustained attention (such as conversations or reading), failure to follow instructions (often resulting in failure to complete schoolwork and other duties), disorganization (difficulty keeping things in order, poor time management, sloppy and messy work), lack of attention to detail, becoming easily distracted, and forgetfulness.

Hyperactivity is characterized by excessive movement, and includes fidgeting or squirming, leaving one's seat in situations when remaining seated is expected, having trouble sitting still (such as in a restaurant), running about and climbing on things, blurting out responses before another person's question or statement has been completed, difficulty waiting for one's turn for something, and interrupting and intruding on others.   
  
Frequently, the hyperactive child comes across as noisy and boisterous. The child’s behavior is hasty, impulsive, and seems to occur without much forethought; these characteristics may explain why adolescents and young adults diagnosed with ADHD receive more traffic tickets and have more automobile accidents than others their age (Thompson, Molina, Pelham, & Gnagy, 2007).

ADHD occurs in about 5 percent of children (APA, 2013). On average, boys are three times more likely to have ADHD than girls; however, such findings might reflect the greater propensity of boys to engage in aggressive and antisocial behavior and thus incur a greater likelihood of being referred to psychological clinics (Barkley, 2006).

Children with ADHD face severe academic and social challenges. Compared to their non-ADHD counterparts, children with ADHD have lower grades and standardized test scores and higher rates of expulsion, grade retention, and dropping out (Loe & Feldman, 2007). They also are less well-liked and more often rejected by their peers (Hoza et al., 2005).

ADHD can persist into adolescence and adulthood (Barkley et al., 2002). A recent study found that 29.3 percent of adults who had been diagnosed with ADHD decades earlier still showed symptoms (Barbaresi et al., 2013). Somewhat troubling, this study also reported that nearly 81 percent of those whose ADHD persists into adulthood had experienced at least one other related medical condition or disorder, compared to 47 percent of those whose ADHD did not persist.

Additional concerns when an adult has ADHD include:

- Worse educational attainment
- Lower socioeconomic status
- Less likely to be employed
- More likely to be divorced
- More likely to have non-alcohol-related substance abuse problems (Klein et al., 2012)

### Causes of ADHD

Family and twin studies indicate that genetics play a significant role in the development of ADHD. Burt (2009), in a review of 26 studies, reported that the median rate for identical twins both experiencing the disorder was about three times the rate for fraternal twins. The specific genes involved in ADHD are thought to include at least two that are important in the regulation of the neurotransmitter **dopamine** (Gizer, Ficks, & Waldman, 2009), suggesting that dopamine may be important in ADHD.

Indeed, medications used in the treatment of ADHD, such as methylphenidate (brand name: Ritalin) and amphetamine with dextroamphetamine (brand name: Adderall), have stimulant qualities and elevate dopamine activity. People with ADHD show less dopamine activity in key regions of the brain, especially those associated with motivation and reward (Volkow et al., 2009), which provides support to the theory that dopamine deficits may be a vital factor in the development of this disorder (Swanson et al., 2007).

Brain imaging studies have shown that children with ADHD exhibit abnormalities in their frontal lobes, an area in which dopamine is in abundance. Compared to children without ADHD, those with ADHD appear to have smaller frontal lobe volume, and they show less frontal lobe activation when performing mental tasks (Banaschewski et al., 2017). Recall that one of the functions of the frontal lobes is to inhibit behavior. Thus, abnormalities in this region may go a long way toward explaining the hyperactive, uncontrolled behavior of ADHD.

Many parents attribute their child's hyperactivity to sugar. A statistical review of 16 studies, however, concluded that sugar consumption has no effect at all on the behavioral and cognitive performance of children (Wolraich, Wilson, & White, 1995). Although food additives have been shown to increase hyperactivity in non-ADHD children, the effect is rather small (McCann et al., 2007).

Numerous studies, however, have shown a significant relationship between exposure to nicotine in cigarette smoke during the prenatal period and ADHD (Linnet et al., 2003; Sourander et al., 2019). Maternal smoking during pregnancy is also associated with the development of more severe symptoms of the disorder (Thakur et al., 2013). Additionally, low birth weight and prematurity have been correlated with ADHD (Banaschewski et al., 2017).

### Treatment for ADHD

Recommended treatment for ADHD includes behavioral interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, parent and teacher education, recreational programs, and lifestyle changes, such as getting more sleep (Clay, 2013). For some children, medication is prescribed.

Parents are often concerned that stimulant medication may result in their child acquiring a substance use disorder. However, research using longitudinal studies has demonstrated that children diagnosed with ADHD who received pharmacological treatment had a lower risk for substance abuse problems than those children who did not receive medication (Wilens, Fararone, Biederman, & Gunawardene, 2003). The risk of substance abuse problems appears to be even greater for those with ADHD who are unmedicated and also exhibit antisocial tendencies (Marshal & Molina, 2006).

### ADHD Rates

Many people believe that the rates of ADHD have increased in recent years, and there is evidence to support this contention. In a recent study, investigators found that the parent-reported prevalence of ADHD among children (4 to 17 years old) in the United States increased by 22 percent during a four-year period, from 7.8 percent in 2003 to 9.5 percent in 2007 (CDC, 2010). ADHD may be over-diagnosed by doctors who are too quick to medicate children as a behavior treatment.

There is also greater awareness of ADHD now than in the past. Nearly everyone has heard of ADHD, and most parents and teachers are aware of its key symptoms. Thus, parents may be quick to take their children to a doctor if they believe their child possesses these symptoms, or teachers may be more likely now than in the past to notice the symptoms and refer the child for evaluation. Further, the use of computers, video games, smartphones, and other electronic devices has become pervasive among children in the early twenty-first century, and these devices could potentially shorten children's attention spans. Thus, what might seem like inattention to some parents and teachers could simply reflect exposure to too much technology.

### Lesson 6: Introduction

Puberty is a stage of human life that witnesses various important physical and mental changes. You will learn about the development of the brain at puberty, especially its adaptive quality, and its impact on the life of an adolescent and how sleeping patterns affect an adolescent.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in cognitive development during puberty

### Adolescent Brain

The brain undergoes dramatic changes during adolescence. Although it does not get larger, it matures by becoming more interconnected and specialized (Giedd, 2015). The myelination and development of connections between neurons continues. This results in an increase in the white matter of the brain and allows adolescents to make significant improvements in their thinking and processing skills.   
  
Different brain areas become myelinated at different times. For example, the brain's language areas undergo a process of attaining maturity during the first 13 years. Completed insulation of the axons consolidates these language skills but makes it more difficult to learn a second language. With greater myelination, however, comes diminished plasticity as a myelin coating inhibits the growth of new connections (Dobbs, 2012).

Even as the connections between neurons are strengthened, synaptic pruning occurs more than during childhood as the brain adapts to changes in the environment. This synaptic pruning causes the gray matter of the brain, the cortex, to become thinner but more efficient (Dobbs, 2012). The corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres, continues to thicken allowing for stronger connections between brain areas. Additionally, the hippocampus becomes more strongly connected to the frontal lobes, allowing for greater integration of memory and experiences into our decision-making.

#### Limbic System

The **limbic system,** which regulates emotion and reward, is linked to the hormonal changes that occur at puberty. The limbic system is also related to novelty seeking and a shift toward interacting with peers. In contrast, the **prefrontal cortex**, which is involved in the control of impulses, organization, planning, and making good decisions, does not fully develop until the mid-20s. According to Giedd (2015) the significant aspect of the later developing prefrontal cortex and early development of the limbic system is the "mismatch" in timing between the two. The approximately 10 years that separate the development of these two brain areas can result in risky behavior, poor decision-making, and weak emotional control for the adolescent. When puberty begins earlier, this mismatch extends even further.

#### Dopamine and Oxytocin

Teens often take more risks than adults, and according to research, it is because they weigh risks and rewards differently than adults do (Dobbs, 2012). For adolescents the brain's sensitivity to the neurotransmitter dopamine peaks, and **dopamine** is involved in reward circuits, so the possible rewards outweigh the risks. Adolescents respond especially strongly to social rewards during activities, and they prefer the company of others their same age. Chein et al. (2011) found that peers sensitize brain regions associated with potential rewards.   
  
For example, adolescent drivers make risky driving decisions when with friends to impress them, and teens are much more likely to commit crimes together in comparison to adults (30 and older) who commit them alone (Steinberg et al., 2018). In addition to dopamine, the adolescent brain is affected by **oxytocin**, which facilitates bonding and makes social connections more rewarding. With both dopamine and oxytocin engaged, it is no wonder that adolescents seek peers and excitement in their lives that could end up actually harming them.

### Changes in Adolescent Brain

Because of all the changes that occur in the adolescent brain, the chances for abnormal development can occur, including mental illness. In fact, 50 percent of mental illness occurs by the age of 14 and 75 percent occurs by age 24 (Giedd, 2015). Additionally, during this period of development, the adolescent brain is especially vulnerable to damage from drug exposure. For example, repeated exposure to marijuana can affect cellular activity. Consequently, adolescents are more sensitive to the effects of repeated marijuana exposure (Weir, 2015).

However, researchers have also focused on the highly adaptive qualities of the adolescent brain that allow the adolescent to move away from the family toward the outside world (Dobbs, 2012; Giedd, 2015). Novelty-seeking and risk-taking can generate positive outcomes, including meeting new people and seeking out new situations. Separating from the family and moving into new relationships and different experiences are actually quite adaptive for society.

### Adolescent Sleep

According to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) (2016), adolescents need about eight to ten hours of sleep each night to function best. The most recent Sleep in America poll in 2006 indicated that adolescents between sixth and twelfth grade were not getting the recommended amount of sleep. On average, adolescents only received 7.5 hours of sleep per night on school nights, with younger adolescents getting more than older ones (8.4 hours for sixth graders and only 6.9 hours for those in twelfth grade).

For the older adolescents, only about one in ten (9 percent) get an optimal amount of sleep, and those who do not get adequate sleep are more likely to experience negative consequences the following day. Negative consequences include feeling too tired or sleepy, being cranky or irritable, falling asleep in school, having a depressed mood, and drinking caffeinated beverages (NSF, 2016). Additionally, they are at risk for substance abuse, car crashes, poor academic performance, obesity, and a weakened immune system (Weintraub, 2016).

Troxel et al. (2019) found that insufficient sleep in adolescents is a predictor for risky sexual behaviors. Reasons given for this include that adolescents who stay out late, typically without parental supervision, are more likely to engage in a variety of risky behaviors, including risky sex such as not using birth control or using substances before or during sex. An alternative explanation for risky sexual behavior is that the lack of sleep negatively affects impulsivity and decision-making processes.

### Why Adolescents Do Not Get Adequate Sleep: Causes and Remedies

In addition to known environmental and social factors—work, homework, media, technology, and socializing—the adolescent brain is also a factor. As adolescents go through puberty, their **circadian rhythms** change and push back their sleep time until later in the evening (Weintraub, 2016).   
  
This biological change not only keeps adolescents awake at night, it makes it difficult for them to wake up. When they are awake too early, their brains do not function optimally. Impairments are noted in attention, academic achievement, and behavior and increase in tardiness and absenteeism are also seen.

#### Sleeping Schedule

To support adolescents' later sleeping schedule, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that school not begin any earlier than 8:30 a.m. Unfortunately, over 80 percent of American schools begin their day earlier than 8:30 a.m., with an average start time of 8:03 a.m. (Weintraub, 2016).   
  
Psychologists and other professionals have been advocating for later school times, and they have produced research demonstrating better student outcomes for later start times. More middle and high schools are now changing their start times to better reflect the sleep research. However, the logistics of changing start times and bus schedules are proving too difficult for some schools, leaving many adolescents vulnerable to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation.   
  
Troxel et al. (2019) cautions that adolescents should find a middle ground between sleeping too little during the school week and too much during the weekends. Keeping consistent sleep schedules of too little sleep will result in sleep deprivation but oversleeping on weekends can affect the natural biological sleep cycle, making it harder to sleep on weekdays.

### Key Term

- **circadian rhythm:** a 24-hour natural pattern that regulates the sleep–wake cycle in individuals

### Lesson Summary

Take a moment to think about what you learned in this lesson. 

- Significant improvement occurs in thinking and processing skills during adolescence due to myelination of neurons in the brain and development of connections between neurons.
- The limbic system controls emotions and is linked to hormonal changes that occur at puberty.
- Dopamine and oxytocin levels increase during adolescence. This makes adolescents seek peers as well as excitement, both of which may prove risky.
- Biological changes in adolescence lead to changes in the circadian rhythm that results in insufficient sleep; this may have various harmful effects.
- Consistent sleep schedules are necessary for adolescents to lead a healthy and meaningful life.

### Lesson 7:  Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about the ability of adolescents to comprehend abstract thoughts and enter the world of hypothetical possibilities. The self-regulatory abilities of adolescents in different situations and the academic and social effects on adolescents of transitions in education are also discussed.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in cognitive development during adolescence.

### Piaget's Formal Operational Stage

During the formal operational stage, adolescents are able to understand **abstract principles** that have no physical reference. They can now contemplate such abstract constructs as beauty, love, freedom, and morality. The adolescent is no longer limited by what can be directly seen or heard. While younger children solve problems through trial and error, adolescents demonstrate **hypothetical-deductive****reasoning**, which is developing hypotheses based on what might logically occur. They are able to think about all the possibilities in a situation beforehand, and then test them systematically (Crain, 2005). Now they are able to engage in true scientific thinking.

Formal operational thinking also involves accepting hypothetical situations. Adolescents understand the concept of **transitivity**, which means that a relationship between two elements is carried over to other elements logically related to the first two, such as if A<B and B<C, then A<C (Thomas, 1979). For example, when asked "If Maria is shorter than Alicia and Alicia is shorter than Caitlyn, who is the shortest?" adolescents are able to answer the question correctly; they understand the transitivity involved.

#### Formal Operational Thinking

According to Piaget, most people attain some degree of formal operational thinking, but use formal operations primarily in the areas of their strongest interest (Crain, 2005). In fact, most adults do not regularly demonstrate formal operational thought, and in small villages and tribal communities, it is barely used at all. A possible explanation is that an individual's thinking has not been sufficiently challenged to demonstrate formal operational thought in all areas.

### Adolescent Egocentrism

Once adolescents can understand abstract thoughts, they enter a world of hypothetical possibilities and demonstrate **egocentrism**, a heightened self-focus. The egocentricity comes from attributing unlimited power to their own thoughts (Crain, 2005). Piaget believed it was not until adolescents took on adult roles that they would be able to learn the limits to their own thoughts.

#### Imaginary Audience

David Elkind (1967) expanded on the concept of Piaget's adolescent egocentricity. Elkind theorized that the physiological changes that occur during adolescence result in adolescents being primarily concerned with themselves. Additionally, since adolescents fail to differentiate between what others are thinking and their own thoughts, they believe that others are just as fascinated with their behavior and appearance. This belief results in the adolescent anticipating the reactions of others, and consequently constructing an **imaginary audience**.

"The imaginary audience is the adolescent's belief that those around them are as concerned and focused on their appearance as they themselves are" (Schwartz, Maynard, & Uzelac, 2008). Elkind thought that the imaginary audience contributed to the self-consciousness that occurs during early adolescence. The desire for privacy and reluctance to share personal information may be a further reaction to feeling under constant observation by others. Alternatively, recent research has indicated that the imaginary audience is not imaginary. Specifically, adolescents and adults feel that they are often under scrutiny by others, especially if they are active on social media (Yau & Reich, 2018).

#### Consequence of Adolescent Egocentrism

Another important consequence of adolescent egocentrism is the **personal fable,** a belief that one is unique, special, and invulnerable to harm. Elkind (1967) explains that because adolescents feel so important to others (the imaginary audience), they regard themselves and their feelings as being special and unique. Adolescents believe that only *they* have experienced strong and diverse emotions, and therefore others could never understand how they feel.

This uniqueness in one's emotional experiences reinforces the adolescent's belief of invulnerability, especially to death. Adolescents will engage in risky behaviors, such as drinking and driving or unprotected sex, and feel they will not suffer any negative consequences. Elkind believed that adolescent egocentricity emerges in early adolescence and declines in middle adolescence, however, recent research has also identified egocentricity in late adolescence (Schwartz, et al., 2008).

### Consequences of Formal Operational Thought

As adolescents are now able to think abstractly and hypothetically, they exhibit many new ways of reflecting on information (Dolgin, 2011). For example, they demonstrate greater **introspection**—thinking about one's thoughts and feelings. They begin to imagine how the world could be, which leads them to become **idealistic**—insisting upon high standards of behavior. Because of their idealism, they may become critical of others, especially adults in their life. 

Adolescents can also demonstrate **hypocrisy**, pretending to be what they are not. Since they are able to recognize what others expect of them, they will conform to those expectations for their emotions and behavior seemingly hypocritical to themselves. Lastly, adolescents can exhibit **pseudostupidity**. This is when they approach problems at a level that is too complex, and they fail because the tasks are too simple. Their new ability to consider alternatives is not completely under control and they appear “stupid” when they are in fact bright, just not experienced.

### Information Processing

Information processing helps an individual to perceive information, then analyze, manipulate, and remember it, and finally, use it as and when required. According to this approach, this ability is continuous and gradual. There are many stages of information processing.

#### Cognitive Control

For adolescents, **executive function** such as attention, increases in working memory, and cognitive flexibility have been steadily improving since early childhood. Studies have found that executive function is very competent in adolescence. However, **self-regulation**—the ability to control impulses—may still fail. A failure in self-regulation often occurs at times of high stress or high demand on mental functions (Luciano & Collins, 2012). While high stress or demand may tax even an adult’s self-regulatory abilities, neurological changes in the adolescent brain may make teens particularly prone to more risky decision-making under these conditions.

#### Inductive and Deductive Reasoning

Inductive reasoning emerges in childhood and occurs when specific observations, or specific comments from those in authority, may be used to draw general conclusions. This is sometimes referred to as “bottom-up processing.” However, in inductive reasoning, the veracity of the information that created the general conclusion does not guarantee the accuracy of that conclusion. For instance, a child who has only observed thunder on summer days may conclude that it only thunders in the summer.   
  
In contrast, deductive reasoning emerges in adolescence and refers to reasoning that starts with some overarching principle and based on this proposes specific conclusions. This is sometimes referred to as “top-down processing.” Deductive reasoning guarantees a truthful conclusion if the premises on which it is based are accurate.

#### Intuitive Thinking versus Analytic Thinking 

**Cognitive psychologists **often refer to intuitive and analytic thought as the **dual-process model**; this is the notion that humans have two distinct networks for processing information (Albert & Steinberg, 2011). **Intuitive thought** is automatic, unconscious, and fast (Kahneman, 2011), and it is more experiential and emotional. In contrast, **analytic****thought** is deliberate, conscious, and rational.   
  
While these systems interact, they are distinct (Kuhn, 2013). Intuitive thought is easier and more commonly used in everyday life. It is also more commonly used by children and teens than by adults (Klaczynski, 2001). The quickness of adolescent thought, along with the maturation of the limbic system, may make teens more prone to emotional intuitive thinking than adults.

### Education in Adolescence

In early adolescence, the transition from elementary school to middle school can be difficult for many students, both academically and socially. Crosnoe and Benner (2015) found that some students become disengaged and alienated during this transition which results in negative long-term consequences in academic performance and mental health. Part of the issue may be that middle school teachers are seen as less supportive than elementary school teachers (Brass, McKellar, North, & Ryan, 2019).   
  
Similarly, the transition from middle school to high school can be difficult. High schools are larger, more bureaucratic, and less personal, and there are fewer opportunities for teachers to get to know their students (Eccles & Rosner, 2016).

#### Peers

Certainly, the beliefs and expectations about academic success by an adolescent's family play a significant role in the student's achievement and school engagement. However, research has also focused on the importance of peers in an adolescent's school experience. Specifically, having friends who are high-achieving, academically motivated, and engaged promotes motivation and engagement in an adolescent, while those with friends who are unmotivated, disengaged, and low-achieving promote similar feelings (Shin & Ryan, 2014; Vaillancourt et al., 2019).

#### Gender

Crosnoe and Benner (2015) found that female students earn better grades, try harder, and are more **intrinsically****motivated** than male students. Further, Duchesne, Larose, and Feng (2019) described female students as more oriented toward skill mastery, used a variety of learning strategies, and persevered more than males. However, more females exhibit worries and anxiety about school, including feeling that they must please teachers and parents. These worries can heighten their efforts but lead to fears of disappointing others.   
  
In contrast, males are more confident and do not value adult feedback regarding their academic performance (Brass et al., 2019). There is a subset of female students who identify with **sexualized gender stereotypes**, however, and they tend to underperform academically. These female students internalize societal stereotypes that females should prioritize their sexual attractiveness while downplaying other traits such as intelligence. Nelson and Brown (2019) found that female students who support sexualized gender stereotypes reported less desire to master skills and concepts, were more skeptical of the usefulness of an education, and downplayed their intelligence.

### Life of a High School Student

On average, high school teens spend approximately seven hours each weekday and 1.1 hours each day on the weekend on educational activities. This includes attending classes, participating in extracurricular activities (excluding sports), and doing homework (Office of Adolescent Health, 2018). High school males and females spend about the same amount of time in class, doing homework, eating and drinking, and working. However, they do spend their time outside of these activities in different ways.

#### High School Males

On average, high school males spend about one more hour per day on media and communications activities than females on both weekdays (2.9 vs. 1.8 hours) and weekend days (4.8 vs. 3.8 hours). They also spend more time playing sports on both weekdays (0.9 vs. 0.5 hours) and weekend days (1.2 vs. 0.5 hours). On weekdays, high school males get an hour more of sleep than females (9.2 vs. 8.2 hours, on average).

#### High School Females

On an average weekday, high school females spend more time than boys on both leisure activities (1.7 vs. 1.1 hours) and religious activities (0.1 vs. 0.0 hours). High school females also spend more time on grooming on both weekdays and weekend days (1.1 vs. 0.7 hours, on average for both weekdays and weekend days).

### High School Dropouts

The **status dropout****rate** refers to the percentage of 16- to 24-year-olds who are not enrolled in school and do not have high school credentials (either a diploma or an equivalency credential). The dropout rate is based on sample surveys of the civilian, non-institutionalized population, which excludes persons in prisons, in the military, and those not living in households. The dropout rate among high school students has declined from a rate of 12 percent in 1990 to 6.1 percent in 2016 (U.S. Department of Education, 2018). The rate is lower for Whites than for Blacks, and the rates for both Whites and Blacks are lower than the rate for Hispanics. However, the gap among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics have narrowed.

The dropout rate for males in 1990 was 12 percent, where it stayed until 2000. Thereafter the rate has dropped to 7.1 percent in 2016. The dropout rate for females in 1990 was 12 percent, and it has dropped to 5.1 percent in 2016 (U.S. Department of Education, 2018).

#### Reasons for Dropping Out of School

Garcia et al. (2018) reviewed the research on why students dropped out of school and identified several major obstacles to school completion. These included adolescents who resided in foster care or were part of the juvenile justice system. In fact, being confined in a juvenile detention facility practically guaranteed that a student would not complete school. Having a physical or mental health condition, or the need for special educational services, adversely affected school completion. Being maltreated due to abuse or neglect or homelessness also contributed to dropping out of school.

Additionally, adolescent-specific factors, including race, ethnicity, and age, as well as family-specific characteristics such as poverty, single parenting, large family size, and stressful transitions all contributed to an increased likelihood of dropping-out of school. Lastly, community factors, such as unsafe neighborhoods, gang activity, and a lack of social services increased the number of school dropouts.

### Lesson 8: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about the psychosocial stages of development during middle childhood. You will also learn about the various studies on the various aspects of development in middle childhood and the impact of peers, friends, and family during this development stage.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in psychosocial development during middle childhood.

### Erikson: Industry vs. Inferiority

According to Erikson, children in middle and late childhood are engaged in the fourth stage of human development, industry vs. inferiority (Erikson, 1982). They are very busy or industrious, constantly doing, planning, playing, getting together with friends, and achieving. This is a very active time and a time when they are gaining a sense of how they measure up when compared with peers. Erikson believed that if these industrious children can be successful in their endeavors, they will get a sense of confidence for future challenges. If not, a sense of inferiority can be particularly haunting during middle and late childhood. 

#### Self-Understanding 

**Self-concept** refers to beliefs about general personal identity (Seiffert, 2011). These beliefs include personal attributes, such as one's age, physical characteristics, behaviors, and competencies. Children in middle and late childhood have a more realistic sense of self than do those in early childhood, and they better understand their strengths and weaknesses. This can be attributed to greater experience in comparing their own performance with that of others and to greater cognitive flexibility.   
  
Children in middle and late childhood are also able to include other peoples' appraisals of them into their self-concept, including parents, teachers, peers, culture, and media. Internalizing others' appraisals and creating social comparison affect children's **self-esteem,** which is defined as an evaluation of one's identity. Children can have individual assessments of how well they perform a variety of activities and also develop an overall global self-assessment. If there is a discrepancy between how children view themselves and what they consider to be their ideal selves, their self-esteem can be negatively affected.

Another important development in self-understanding is **self-efficacy,** which is the belief that you are capable of carrying out a specific task or of reaching a specific goal (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997). Large discrepancies between self-efficacy and ability can create motivational problems for the individual (Seifert, 2011). If a student believes that they can solve mathematical problems, then the student is more likely to attempt the mathematics homework that the teacher assigns.   
  
Unfortunately, the converse is also true. If a student believes that they are incapable of math, then the student is less likely to attempt the math homework regardless of the student's actual ability in math. Since self-efficacy is self-constructed, it is possible for students to miscalculate or misperceive their true skill, and these misperceptions can have complex effects on students' motivations. It is possible to have either too much or too little self-efficacy, and according to Bandura (1997) the optimum level seems to be either at or slightly above true ability.

### The Kohlberg Stages of Moral Development

Kohlberg (1963) built on the work of Piaget and was interested in finding out how moral reasoning changes as people get older. He wanted to find out how people decide what is right and what is wrong. Just as Piaget believed that children's cognitive development follows specific patterns, Kohlberg (1984) argued that people learn moral values through active thinking and reasoning and that moral development follows a series of stages. Kohlberg's six stages are generally organized into three levels of moral reasons. To study moral development, Kohlberg posed moral dilemmas to children, teenagers, and adults, such as the following:

A man's wife is dying of cancer, and there is only one drug that can save her. The only place to get the drug is at the store of a pharmacist who is known to overcharge people for drugs. The man can only pay $1,000, but the pharmacist wants $2,000 and refuses to sell it to him for less or to let him pay later. Desperate, the man later breaks into the pharmacy and steals the medicine. Should he have done that? Was it right or wrong? Why? (Kohlberg, 1984)

#### The Kohlberg Stages and Moral Reasons

- **Level One—Preconventional morality:** In stage one, moral reasoning is based on concepts of punishment. The child believes that if the consequence for an action is punishment, then the action was wrong. In the second stage, the child bases thinking on self-interest and reward. "You scratch my back; I'll scratch yours." The youngest subjects seemed to answer based on what would happen to the man in the question as a result of the act.  
  
For example, they might say the man should not break into the pharmacy because the pharmacist might find him and beat him. Or they might say that the man should break in and steal the drug, and his wife will give him a big kiss. Right or wrong, both decisions were based on what would physically happen to the man as a result of the act. This is a self-centered approach to moral decision-making.   
  
Kohlberg called this most superficial understanding of right and wrong **preconventional morality.** Preconventional morality focuses on self-interest. Punishment is avoided, and rewards are sought. Adults can also fall into these stages, particularly when they are under pressure.  
  

- **Level Two—Conventional morality:** Those tested who based their answers to the question about the man and the pharmacist on what other people would think of the man as a result of his act were placed in Level Two. For instance, they might say he should break into the store, and then everyone would think he was a good husband, or he should not because it is against the law.   
  
In either case, right and wrong are determined by what other people think. In stage three, the person wants to please others.   
  
At stage four, the person acknowledges the importance of social norms or laws and wants to be a good member of the group or society. A good decision is one that gains the approval of others or one that complies with the law. This Kohlberg called **conventional morality;** people care about the effect of their actions on others. Some older children, adolescents, and adults use this reasoning.  
  

- **Level Three—Postconventional morality:** Right and wrong are based on social contracts established for the good of everyone, and that can transcend the self and social convention. For example, the man should break into the store because, even if it is against the law, the wife needs the drug, and her life is more important than the consequences the man might face for breaking the law. Alternatively, the man should not violate the principle of the right of property because this rule is essential for social order.   
  
In either case, the person's judgment goes beyond what happens to the self. It is based on a concern for others, society as a whole, or an ethical standard rather than a legal standard. This level is called postconventional moral development because it goes beyond convention or what other people think to a higher, universal ethical principle of conduct that may or may not be reflected in the law.   
  
Notice that such thinking is the kind Supreme Court justices do all day when deliberating whether a law is moral or ethical, which requires being able to think abstractly. Often this is not accomplished until a person reaches adolescence or adulthood. In the fifth stage, laws are recognized as social contracts. The reasons for the laws, like justice, equality, and dignity, are used to evaluate decisions and interpret laws.   
  
In the sixth stage, individually determined universal ethical principles are weighed to make moral decisions. Kohlberg said that few people ever reach this stage. The six stages are shown in the “Lawrence Kohlberg’s Levels of Moral Reasoning” Table.

### Lawrence Kohlberg’s Levels of Moral Reasoning

Although research has supported Kohlberg's idea that moral reasoning changes from an early emphasis on punishment and social rules and regulations to an emphasis on more general ethical principles, as with Piaget's approach, Kohlberg's stage model is probably too simple. For one thing, people may use higher levels of reasoning for some types of problems but revert to lower levels in situations where doing so is more consistent with their goals or beliefs (Rest, 1979).

Second, it has been argued that the stage model is particularly appropriate for Western, rather than non-Western, samples in which allegiance to social norms, such as respect for authority, may be particularly important (Haidt, 2001). In addition, there is frequently little correlation between how people score on the moral stages and how they behave in real life.  

#### Table S2, L8.2 Lawrence Kohlberg's Levels of Moral Reasoning
AgeMoral LevelDescription**Young children usually prior to age nine****Preconventional morality****Stage 1:** Focus is on self-interest, and punishment is avoided. The man should not steal the drug, as he may get caught and go to jail.

**Stage 2:** Rewards are sought. A person at this level will argue that the man should steal the drug because he does not want to lose his wife, who takes care of him.
**Older children, adolescents, and most adult****Conventional morality****Stage 3:** Focus is on how situational outcomes impact others and wanting to please and be accepted. The man should steal the drug because that is what good husbands do.

**Stage 4:** People make decisions based on laws or formalized rules. The man should obey the law because stealing is a crime.
**Rare with adolescents and few adults****Postconventional morality****Stage 5:** Individuals employ abstract reasoning to justify behaviors. The man should steal the drug because laws can be unjust, and you have to consider the whole situation. 

**Stage 6:** Moral behavior is based on self-chosen ethical principles. The man should steal the drug because life is more important than property.

  
Perhaps the most important critique of Kohlberg's theory is that it may describe the moral development of males better than it describes that of females. Gilligan (1982) has argued that, because of differences in their socialization, males tend to value principles of justice and rights, whereas females value caring for and helping others. Although there is little evidence for a gender difference in Kohlberg's stages of moral development (Turiel, 1998), it is true that girls and women tend to focus more on issues of caring, helping, and connecting with others than do boys and men (Jaffee & Hyde, 2000).

### Friends 

As toddlers, children may begin to show a preference for certain playmates (Ross & Lollis, 1989). However, peer interactions at this age often involve more parallel play rather than intentional social interactions (Pettit et al., 1996). By age four, many children use the word "friend" when referring to certain children and do so with a fair degree of stability (Hartup, 1983). However, among young children, "friendship" is often based on proximity, such as living next door, attending the same school, or just happen to be playing with at the time (Rubin, 1980).

Friendships take on new importance as judges of one's worth, competence, and attractiveness in middle and late childhood. Friendships provide the opportunity for learning social skills, such as how to communicate with others and how to negotiate differences. Children get ideas from one another about how to perform certain tasks, how to gain popularity, what to wear or say, and how to act.   
  
This society of children marks a transition from a life focused on the family to a life concerned with peers. During middle and late childhood, peers increasingly play an important role. For example, peers play a key role in a child's self-esteem at this age, as any parent who has tried to console a rejected child will tell you. No matter how complimentary and encouraging the parent may be, being rejected by friends can only be remedied by renewed acceptance.   
  
Children's conceptualization of what makes someone a "friend" changes from a more egocentric understanding to one based on mutual trust and commitment. Both Bigelow (1977) and Selman (1980) believe that these changes are linked to advances in cognitive development.

### Stages of Friendship

Bigelow and La Gaipa (1975) outline three stages to children's conceptualization of friendship. In stage one, called reward-cost, friendship focuses on mutual activities. Children in early, middle, and late childhood all emphasize similar interests as the main characteristics of a good friend. Stage two, called normative expectation, focuses on conventional morality; that is, the emphasis is on a friend as someone who is kind and shares. Clark and Bittle (1992) found that fifth-graders emphasized this in a friend more than third or eighth graders.

In the final stage, called empathy and understanding, friends are people who are loyal, committed to the relationship, and share intimate information. Clark and Bittle (1992) reported eighth-graders emphasized this more in a friend. They also found that as early as fifth grade, girls were starting to include a sharing of secrets and not betraying confidences as crucial to someone who is a friend.

Selman (1980) outlines five stages of friendship from early childhood through to adulthood:

- **Momentary physical interaction:** A friend is someone you are playing with at this point in time. Selman (1980) notes that this is typical of children between the ages of three and six. These early friendships are based more on circumstances (for example, a neighbor) than on genuine similarities.
- **One-way assistance:** A friend is someone who does nice things for you, such as saving you a seat on the school bus or sharing a toy. However, children in this stage do not always think about what they are contributing to the relationships. Nonetheless, having a friend is important, and children will sometimes put up with a not-so-nice friend just to have a friend. Children as young as five and as old as nine may be in this stage.
- **Fair-weather cooperation:** Children are very concerned with fairness and reciprocity, and thus, a friend is someone who returns a favor. In this stage, if a child does something nice for a friend, there is an expectation that the friend will do something nice for them at the first available opportunity. When this fails to happen, a child may break off the friendship. Selman found that some children as young as 7 and as old as 12 are in this stage. 
- **Intimate and mutual sharing:** Typically between the ages of 8 and 15, a friend is someone to whom you can tell things you would tell no one else. Children and teens in this stage no longer "keep score" and do things for a friend because they genuinely care for the person. If a friendship dissolves in this stage, it is usually due to a violation of trust. However, children in this stage do expect their friends to share similar interests and viewpoints and may take it as a betrayal if a friend likes someone that they do not.
- **Autonomous interdependence:** A friend is someone who accepts you and whom you accept as they are. In this stage, children, teens, and adults accept and even appreciate differences between themselves and their friends. They are also not as possessive, so they are less likely to feel threatened if their friends have other relationships or interests. Children are typically 12 or older in this stage.

### Lesbian and Gay Parenting

Research has consistently shown that the children of lesbian and gay parents are as successful as those of heterosexual parents, and consequently, efforts are being made to ensure that gay and lesbian couples are provided with the same legal rights as heterosexual couples when adopting children (American Civil Liberties Union, 2016).

Patterson (2013) reviewed more than 25 years of social science research on the development of children raised by lesbian and gay parents and found no evidence of detrimental effects. In fact, research has demonstrated that children of lesbian and gay parents are as well-adjusted overall as those of heterosexual parents. Specifically, research comparing children based on parental sexual orientation has not shown any differences in the development of gender identity, gender role development, or sexual orientation.

Additionally, there were no differences between the children of lesbian or gay parents and those of heterosexual parents in separation-individuation, behavior problems, self-concept, locus of control, moral judgment, school adjustment, intelligence, victimization, and substance use. Further, research has consistently found that children and adolescents of gay and lesbian parents report normal social relationships with family members, peers, and other adults. Patterson concluded that there is no evidence to support legal discrimination or policy bias against lesbian and gay parents.

### Divorce

Using families in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, Weaver and Schofield (2015) found that children from divorced families had significantly more behavior problems than those from a matched sample of children from non-divorced families. These problems were evident immediately after the separation and also in early and middle adolescence.

An analysis of divorce factors indicated that children exhibited more externalizing behaviors if the family had fewer financial resources before the separation. It was hypothesized that the lower income and lack of educational and community resources contributed to the stress involved in the divorce. Additional factors contributing to children's behavior problems included a post-divorce home that was less supportive and stimulating and a less sensitive and more depressed mother.

Additional concerns include that the child will grieve the loss of the parent they no longer see as frequently. The child may also grieve about other family members that are no longer available. Very often, divorce means a change in the amount of money coming into the household. Custodial mothers experience a 25 percent to 50 percent drop in their family income, and even five years after the divorce, they have reached only 94 percent of their pre-divorce family income (Anderson, 2018). As a result, children experience new constraints on spending or entertainment.

School-aged children, especially, may notice that they can no longer have toys, clothing, or other items to which they have grown accustomed. Or it may mean that there is less eating out or being able to afford participation in extracurricular activities. The custodial parent may experience stress at not being able to rely on child support payments or having the same level of income as before. This can affect decisions regarding healthcare, vacations, rents, mortgages, and other expenditures, and the stress can result in less happiness and relaxation in the home. The parent who has to take on more work may also be less available to the children. Children may also have to adjust to other changes accompanying a divorce. The divorce might mean moving to a new home and changing schools or friends. It might mean leaving a neighborhood that has meant a lot to them as well. 

Relationships of adult children of divorce are identified as more problematic than those adults from intact homes. For 25 years, Hetherington and Kelly (2002) followed children of divorce and those whose parents stayed together. The results indicated that 25 percent of adults whose parents had divorced experienced social, emotional, or psychological problems compared with only 10 percent of those whose parents remained married.

For example, children of divorce have more difficulty forming and sustaining intimate relationships as young adults, are more dissatisfied with their marriage, and consequently, more likely to get divorced themselves (Arkowitz & Lilienfeld, 2013). One of the most commonly cited long-term effects of divorce is that children of divorce may have lower levels of education or occupational status (Richter & Lemola, 2017). This may be a consequence of lower income and resources for funding education rather than to divorce per se. In those households where economic hardship does not occur, there may be no impact on long-term economic status (Drexler, 2005).

According to Arkowitz and Lilienfeld (2013), long-term harm from parental divorce is not inevitable, however, and children can navigate the experience successfully. A variety of factors can positively contribute to the child's adjustment. For example, children manage better when parents limit conflict and provide warmth, emotional support, and appropriate discipline. Further, children cope better when they reside with a well-functioning parent and have access to social support from peers and other adults. Those at a higher socioeconomic status may fare better because some of the negative consequences of divorce are a result of financial hardship rather than divorce per se (Anderson, 2014; Drexler, 2005).

When considering the research findings on the consequences of divorce, it is important for children to consider all the factors that can influence the outcome, as some of the negative consequences associated with divorce are due to preexisting problems (Anderson, 2018). Although they may experience more problems than children from non-divorced families, most children of divorce lead happy, well-adjusted lives and develop strong, positive relationships with their custodial parent (Seccombe & Warner, 2004).

Children from single-parent families talk to their mothers more often than children of two-parent families (McLanahan & Sandefur, 1994). In a study of college-age respondents, Arditti (1999) found that increasing closeness and a movement toward more democratic parenting styles were experienced. Others have also found that relationships between mothers and children become closer and stronger (Guttman, 1993) and suggest that greater equality and less rigid parenting is beneficial after divorce (Steward et al., 1997).

Certain characteristics of the child can also facilitate post-divorce adjustment. Specifically, children with an easygoing temperament who problem-solve well and seek social support manage better after divorce. A further protective factor for children is intelligence (Weaver & Schofield, 2015). Children with higher IQ scores appear to be buffered from the effects of divorce. Children may be given more opportunities to discover their own abilities and gain independence that fosters self-esteem.

If divorce means a reduction in tension, the child may feel relief. Overall, not all children of divorce suffer negative consequences (Hetherington & Kelly, 2002). Furstenberg and Cherlin (1991) believe that the primary factor influencing how children adjust to divorce is how the custodial parent adjusts to the divorce. If that parent is adjusting well, the children will benefit. This may explain a good deal of the variation we find in children of divorce.

#### Cohabitation and Remarriage

The remarriage of a parent may be a more difficult adjustment for a child than the divorce of a parent (Seccombe & Warner, 2004). Parents and children typically have different ideas of how the stepparent should act. Parents and stepparents are more likely to see the stepparent's role as that of a parent. A more democratic style of parenting may become more authoritarian after a parent remarries.

Biological parents are more likely to continue to be involved with their children jointly when neither parent has remarried. They are least likely to jointly be involved if the father has remarried and the mother has not. Cohabitation can be difficult for children to adjust to because cohabiting relationships in the United States tend to be short-lived. About 50 percent last less than two years (Brown, 2000). The child who starts a relationship with the parent's live-in partner may have to sever this relationship later. Even in long-term cohabiting relationships, once it is over, continued contact with the child is rare.

### Blended Families

One in six children (16 percent) lives in blended families (Pew Research Center, 2015). Hispanic, Black, and White children are equally likely to be living in a blended family. In contrast, children of Asian descent are more likely to be living with two married parents, often in their first marriage. Blended families are not new. In the 1700s and 1800s, there were many blended families, but they were created mostly because someone died and remarried. Most blended families today are a result of divorce and remarriage, and such origins lead to new considerations.

Blended families are different from intact families and more complex in a number of ways that can pose unique challenges to those who seek to form successful blended family relationships (Visher & Visher, 1985). Children may be a part of two households, each with different rules that can be confusing.

Members in blended families may not be as sure that others care and may require more demonstrations of affection for reassurance. For example, stepparents expect more gratitude and acknowledgment from the stepchild than they would with a biological child. Stepchildren experience more uncertainty/insecurity in their relationship with the parent and fear the parents will see them as sources of tension. Stepparents may feel guilty for lack of feelings they may initially have toward their partner's children. Children who are required to respond to the parent's new mate as though they were the child's "real" parent often react with hostility, rebellion, or withdrawal. This occurs especially if there has not been time for the relationship to develop.

### Lesson 9: Introduction

Adolescence is a time of new experiences in the realm of psychosocial development, which can include risky sexual behavior. Another danger for adolescents is the appearance of an eating disorder, which can have serious consequences. In this lesson, you will learn about both these common possibilities.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in psychosocial development during puberty.

### Adolescent Sexual Activity

By about age ten or eleven, most children experience increased sexual attraction to others that affects social life, both in school and out (McClintock & Herdt, 1996). By the end of high school, more than half of boys and girls report having experienced **sexual intercourse** at least once, though it is hard to be certain of the proportion because of the sensitivity and privacy of the information (Center for Disease Control, 2004; Rosenbaum, 2006). 

#### Adolescent Pregnancy

According to studies, in 2018 females aged 15 to19 years experienced a birth rate (live births) of 17.4 per 1,000 women. The birth rate for teenagers has declined by 58 percent since 2007 and by 72 percent since 1991, the most recent peak (Hamilton, Martin, Osterman, & Rossen, 2019). It appears that adolescents are less sexually active than in previous decades, and those who are sexually active seem to be using **birth control** (CDC, 2016).

#### Risks of Adolescent Pregnancy

Miller, Benson, and Galbraith (2001) found that parent-child closeness, parental supervision, and parents' values opposing teen intercourse (or unprotected intercourse) decrease the risk of adolescent pregnancy**. **In contrast, these things place adolescents at an increased risk of pregnancy: residing in disorganized or dangerous neighborhoods; living in a family of a lower social-economic status; living with a single parent; having older sexually active siblings, or pregnant or parenting teenage sisters; early puberty; and being a victim of sexual abuse.

#### Consequences of Adolescent Pregnancy

After the child is born, life can be difficult for a teenage mother. Only about half of teenagers who have children before age 18 graduate from high school. Without a high school degree, job prospects are limited, and economic independence is difficult. Teen mothers are more likely to live in poverty, and more than 75 percent of all unmarried teen mothers receive public assistance within five years of the birth of their first child. Approximately, 64 percent of children born to an unmarried, teenage high-school dropout live in poverty. Further, a child born to a teenage mother is 50 percent more likely to repeat a grade in school, perform poorly on standardized tests, and drop out before finishing high school (March of Dimes, 2012).  
  
Research analyzing the age that men father their first child and how far they complete their education has been summarized by the Pew Research Center (2015) and reflects the research for females. Among fathers aged 22 to 44, 70 percent of those with less than a high school diploma say they fathered their first child before the age of 25. In comparison, less than half (45 percent) of fathers with some college experience became fathers by that age. Additionally, becoming a young father occurs much less for those with a bachelor's degree or higher, as just 14 percent had their first child prior to age 25. Like men, women with more education are likely to be older when they become mothers.

### Eating Disorders

Although eating disorders****can occur in children and adults, they most frequently appear during the teen years or young adulthood (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2016). Eating disorders affect both genders, although rates among women are 2½ times greater than among men. Similar to women who have eating disorders, men also may have a distorted sense of body image, including **muscle dysmorphia**, which is an extreme desire to increase one's muscularity (Bosson et al., 2019). The prevalence of eating disorders in the United States is similar among all ethnic groups, with the exception that **anorexia****nervosa **is more common among non-Hispanic Whites (Hudson et al., 2007; Wade et al., 2011).

#### Risks of Eating Disorders

Researchers are finding that eating disorders are caused by a complex interaction of genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors (NIMH, 2016). Eating disorders appear to run in families, and researchers are working to identify DNA variations that are linked to the increased risk of developing eating disorders. Researchers from King's College London (2019) found that the genetic basis of anorexia nervosa overlaps with both metabolic and body measurement traits. Genetic factors also influence physical activity, which may explain the high activity level of those with anorexia.   
  
Further, the genetic basis of anorexia overlaps with other psychiatric disorders. Researchers have found differences in patterns of brain activity in women with eating disorders in comparison to healthy women. The main criteria for the most common eating disorders—anorexia nervosa, **bulimia nervosa**, and **binge-eating disorder**—are described in the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*, Fifth Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and shown in this table.

### Risks of Eating Disorders

#### Table S2, L9.2 DSM-5 Eating Disorders

• self-evaluation is unduly affected by body shape and weightBinge-Eating Disorder• recurrent episodes of binge eating  
• marked distress regarding binge eating  
• binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behavior
### Consequences and Treatment of Eating Disorders

#### Consequences

For those suffering from anorexia nervosa, health consequences include an abnormally slow heart rate and low blood pressure, which increase the risk for heart failure. Additionally, there is a reduction in bone density (osteoporosis), muscle loss and weakness, severe dehydration, fainting, fatigue, and overall weakness. Anorexia nervosa has the highest **mortality rate** of any psychiatric disorder (Arcelus et al., 2011). Individuals with this disorder may die from complications associated with starvation, while others die of suicide. In women, suicide is much more common in those with anorexia than with most other mental disorders.

The binge-and-purge cycle of bulimia nervosa can affect the digestive system and lead to electrolyte and chemical imbalances that can affect the heart and other major organs. Frequent vomiting can cause inflammation and possible rupture of the esophagus, as well as tooth decay and staining from stomach acids. Lastly, binge-eating disorder results in similar health risks to obesity, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and gall bladder disease (National Eating Disorders Association, 2016). 

#### Treatment

To treat eating disorders, adequate nutrition and stopping inappropriate behaviors such as purging are the foundations of treatment. Treatment plans are tailored to individual needs and include medical care, nutritional counseling, medications (such as antidepressants), and individual, group, and/or family psychotherapy (NIMH, 2016). For example, one common approach actively involves parents of adolescents with anorexia nervosa in their child's treatment, including assuming responsibility for feeding the child. To eliminate binge eating and purging behaviors, cognitive behavioral therapy assists sufferers by identifying distorted thinking patterns and changing inaccurate beliefs.

### Lesson 10: Introduction

Psychosocial development in adolescence is related to the interrelation of social factors, individual thought, and behavior. In this lesson, you will explore the changes in self-concept and self-esteem in adolescence, Erikson's fifth psychosocial task of identity vs. role confusion, Marcia's four identity statuses, and the three stages of ethnic identity development.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain major stages in psychosocial development during adolescence.

### Self-Concept and Self-Esteem in Adolescence

In adolescence, teens continue to develop their self-concept. Their ability to think of possibilities and to reason more abstractly may explain the further development of the self during adolescence. However, a teen's understanding of "self" is often full of contradictions. Young teens may see themselves as outgoing but also appear withdrawn, may say they are happy yet are often moody, and be both smart and completely clueless (Harter, 2012).   
  
These contradictions, along with the teen's growing recognition that their personality and behavior seem to change, depending on where they are or who they are with, can lead the young teen to feel like a fraud. With their parents they may seem angrier and sullen; with their friends they are more outgoing and goofier; and at work they are quiet and cautious. "Which one is really me?" may be the refrain of the young teenager. Harter (2012) found that adolescents value traits such as being friendly and considerate more than do children, highlighting their increasing concern about how others see them. Harter also found that older teens add "values" and "moral standards" to their self-descriptions.

As self-concept varies, so too does self-esteem. In addition to academic, social, physical, and athletic dimensions of self-esteem in middle and late childhood, teens also add perceptions of their competency in romantic relationships, on the job, and in close friendships (Harter, 2006). Self-esteem often drops when children transition from one school setting to another, such as shifting from elementary to middle school, or junior high to high school (Ryan et al., 2013). These drops are usually temporary, unless there are additional stressors such as parental conflict or other family disruptions (De Wit st al., 2011). Self-esteem rises from mid to late adolescence for most teenagers, especially if they feel competent in their peer relationships, their appearance, and athletic abilities (Birkeland et al, 2012).

### Erikson: Identity vs. Role Confusion

Erikson believed that the primary psychosocial task of adolescence was establishing an identity. Teens struggle with the question "Who am I?" This includes concerns about appearance, vocational and career aspirations, education, relationships, sexuality, political and social views, personality, and individual interests. Erikson saw this as a period of confusion and experimentation regarding identity and one's life path.   
  
During adolescence, teens put commitment to an identity "on hold" while exploring the options. The culmination of this exploration is a more coherent view of oneself. Those who are unsuccessful at resolving this stage may either withdraw further into social isolation or become lost in the crowd. However, more recent research suggests that few leave this age period with identity achievement, and that most identity formation occurs during young adulthood (Côtè, 2006).

Expanding on Erikson's theory, James Marcia (2010) identified four identity statuses that represent the four possible combinations of the dimension of commitment and exploration, shown in this table.

#### Table S2, L10.2 Marcia's Four Identity Statuses
ExplorationCommitment to an Identity   
  
  
  
**Absent****Present****Absent**Identity diffusionIdentity moratorium**Present**Identity foreclosureIdentity achievement
####   
  
Marcia’s Four Identity Statuses

The least mature status—one common in many children—is **identity diffusion**. Identity diffusion****is a status that characterizes those who have neither explored the options nor made a commitment to an identity. Those who persist in this identity may drift aimlessly with little connection to those around them or have little sense of purpose in life.
[Opens in new tab](https://assets.wgu.edu/79fa0f72df2c88984f0238d52d33ecaa)"[Portrait of red haired teenage girl - stock photoOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/portrait-of-red-haired-teenage-girl-royalty-free-image/1286532459)" by martin-dm, [Getty Images Content License AgreementOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.com/eula#RF)
Those in **identity foreclosure** have made a commitment to an identity without having explored the options. Some parents make these decisions for their children and do not grant the teen the opportunity to make their own choices. In other instances, teens may strongly identify with parents and others in their life and wish to follow in their footsteps.

**Identity moratorium** is a status that describes those who are actively exploring in an attempt to establish an identity but have yet to make a commitment. This can be an anxious and emotionally tense time period as the adolescent experiments with different roles and explores various beliefs. Nothing is certain, and there are many questions but few answers.

**Identity achievement** refers to those who, after exploration, have made a commitment. This is a long process and is not often achieved by the end of adolescence.

During high school and college years, teens and young adults move from identity diffusion and foreclosure toward moratorium and achievement. The biggest gains in the development of identity are in college, as college students are exposed to a greater variety of career choices, lifestyles, and beliefs. This is likely to spur on questions regarding identity. A great deal of the identity work done in adolescence and young adulthood is about values and goals, as people strive to articulate a personal vision or dream for what they hope to accomplish in the future (McAdams, 2013).

### Identity Development

Identity is not a simple concept; in fact, it has many facets. Any one person may have identities that include son, husband, father, Italian, neighbor, engineer, singer, Methodist, activist, gamer, student, and on and on.

Developmental psychologists have researched several different areas of identity development: 

- **Religious identity:** The religious views of teens are often similar to that of their families (Kim-Spoon et al., 2012). Most teens may question specific customs, practices, or ideas in the faith of their parents, but few completely reject the religion of their families.   
  

- **Political identity:** The political ideology of teens is also influenced by their parents' political beliefs. A new trend in the twenty-first century is a decrease in party affiliation among American adults. Many adults do not align themselves with either the Democratic or the Republican party but view themselves as "independent." Their teenage children are often following suit or become more apolitical (Côtè, 2006).   
  

- **Vocational identity:** While adolescents in earlier generations envisioned themselves as working in a particular job and often worked as an apprentice or part-time as teenagers, this is rarely the case today. Vocational identity takes longer to develop, as most of today's occupations require specific skills and knowledge that require additional education or on-the-job training. In addition, many of the jobs held by teens are not in occupations they seek as adults.  
  

- **Gender identity:** Acquiring a gender identity is becoming an increasingly prolonged task as attitudes and norms regarding gender keep changing. The roles appropriate for males and females are evolving, and the changing view of gender as "binary" (that is, only either male or female) allows adolescents more freedom to explore various aspects of gender. Some teens may foreclose on a gender identity as a way of dealing with this uncertainty, and they may adopt more stereotypic male or female roles (Sinclair & Carlsson, 2013).   
  

- **Sexual identity:** According to Carroll (2016), by age 14 most adolescents become interested in intimate relationships, and they may begin sexual experimentation. Many adolescents feel pressure to express interest in opposite-sex relationships, even if they are not ready to do so. This pressure can be especially stressful for those adolescents who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or questioning their sexual identity.   
  
Many non-heterosexual adolescents struggle with negative peer and family reactions during their exploration. A lack of parental acceptance, especially, can adversely affect the gay, lesbian, or bisexual adolescent's emerging sexual identity and can result in feelings of depression. In contrast, adolescents whose families support their sexual identity have better health outcomes.

### Ethnic Identity

**Ethnic identity** refers to how people come to terms with who they are based on their ethnic or racial ancestry. "The task of ethnic identity formation involves sorting out and resolving positive and negative feelings and attitudes about one's own ethnic group and about other groups and identifying one's place in relation to both" (Phinney, 2006).   
  
When groups differ in status in a culture, those from the non-dominant group have to be cognizant of the customs and values of those from the dominant culture. The reverse is rarely the case. This makes ethnic identity far less problematic for members of the dominant culture.   
  
In the United States, people of European ancestry engage in less exploration of ethnic identity than do those of non-European ancestry (Phinney, 1989). However, according to the U.S. Census (2021) 47 percent of Americans under the age of 18 are from ethnic minorities. For many ethnic minority teens, discovering one's ethnic identity is an important part of identity formation.

### Phinney's Model

Phinney's model of ethnic identity formation is based on Erikson's and Marcia's model of identity formation (Phinney, 1990; Syed & Juang, 2014). Through the process of exploration and commitment, individuals come to understand and create an ethnic identity. Phinney suggests three stages, or statuses, with regard to ethnic identity: 

1. **Unexamined Ethnic Identity:** Adolescents and adults who have not been exposed to ethnic identity issues may be in the first stage, unexamined ethnic identity. This is often characterized with a preference for the dominant culture or simply a situation in which the individual has given little thought to their ethnic heritage. This is similar to diffusion in Marcia's model of identity. Included in this group are also those who have adopted the ethnicity of their parents and other family members with little thought about the issues themselves, similar to Marcia's foreclosure status (Phinney, 1990). 
2. **Ethnic Identity Search:** Adolescents and adults who are exploring the customs, culture, and history of their ethnic group are in the ethnic identity search stage, similar to Marcia's moratorium status (Phinney, 1990). Often some event "awakens" a teen or adult to their ethnic group—either a personal experience with prejudice, a highly profiled case in the media, or a positive event that recognizes the contribution of someone from the individual's ethnic group. Teens and adults in this stage will immerse themselves in their ethnic culture. For some, this exploration "may lead to a rejection of the values of the dominant culture" (Phinney, 1990, p. 503). 
3. **Achieved Ethnic Identity:** Those who have actively explored their culture are likely to have a deeper appreciation and understanding of their ethnic heritage, leading to progress toward an achieved ethnic identity (Phinney, 1990). An achieved ethnic identity does not necessarily imply that the individual is highly involved in the customs and values of their ethnic culture. One can be confident in their ethnic identity without wanting to maintain the language or other customs.

#### Ethnic Identity Development 

The development of ethnic identity takes time, with about 25 percent of tenth graders from ethnic minority backgrounds having explored and resolved the issues (Phinney, 1989). The more ethnically homogeneous the high school, the less identity exploration and achievement (Umana-Taylor, 2003). Moreover, even in ethnically diverse high schools, teens tend to spend more time with their own groups, reducing exposure to other ethnicities. This may explain why, for many, college becomes the time of ethnic identity exploration. "[The] transition to college may serve as a consciousness-raising experience that triggers exploration" (Syed & Azmitia, 2009, p. 618).

It is also important to note that those who do achieve ethnic identity may periodically re-examine the issues of ethnicity. This cycling between exploration and achievement is common not only for ethnic identity formation, but in other aspects of identity development (Grotevant, 1987) and is referred to as **MAMA cycling**—moving back and forth between moratorium and achievement. 

### Bicultural and Multiracial Identities

Ethnic minorities often wrestle with the question of how and to what extent they will identify with the culture of the surrounding society and with the culture of their family. Phinney (2006) suggests that people may handle it in different ways. Some may keep the identities separate, others may combine them in some way, while others may reject some of them.

**Bicultural identity** means seeing oneself as part of both the ethnic minority group and the larger society. Those who are **multiracial**—that is, whose parents come from two or more ethnic or racial groups—have a more challenging task. In some cases, their appearance may be ambiguous. This can lead to others constantly asking them to categorize themselves. Phinney (2006) notes that the process of identity formation may start earlier and take longer to accomplish in those who are biracial or multiracial.

### Negative Identity

A **negative identity** is the adoption of norms and values that are the opposite of one's family and culture, and it is assumed to be one of the more problematic outcomes of identity development in young people (Hihara et al., 2019). Those with a negative identity hold "all or nothing" beliefs and consequently divide the world into two categories (friend or foe, good or bad). Hihara et al. suggest that this may be because teens with a negative identity cannot integrate information and beliefs that exist in both their inner and outer world.

In addition, those with a negative identity are generally hostile and cynical toward society, often because they do not trust the world around them. These beliefs may lead teens to engage in delinquent and criminal behavior and prevent them from engaging in more positive acts that could be beneficial to society.

### Lesson 11: Introduction

The stage from childhood to adolescence is a very delicate stage in which people experience emotional, physical, and psychological changes that shape their lifelong emotional life and behavior. 

In this lesson, you will learn how emotions influence psychosocial development and behavior from middle childhood through adolescence.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain how emotions influence psychosocial development from middle childhood through adolescence.

### Autonomy and Attachment 

While most adolescents get along with their parents, they do spend less time with them than they did when they were younger (Smetana, 2011). This decrease in the time spent with families may be a reflection of a teenager's greater desire for independence, or** autonomy.** It can be difficult for many parents to deal with this desire, but it is likely adaptive for teenagers to distance themselves and establish relationships outside of their families in preparation for adulthood. This means that both parents and teenagers need to strike a balance between autonomy and maintaining close and supportive familial relationships. 

Children in middle and late childhood are increasingly granted greater freedom regarding moment-to-moment decision-making. This continues in adolescence, as teens demand greater control over decisions that affect their daily lives. This can increase conflict between parents and their teenagers, often centering on chores, homework, curfew, dating, and personal appearance. These are all things that many teens believe they should manage but over which parents previously had considerable control. 

Teens report more conflict with their mothers, as many mothers believe they should still have some control over many of these areas, yet they often report their mothers to be more encouraging and supportive (Costigan et al., 2007). As teens grow older, more compromises are reached between parents and teenagers (Smetana, 2011). Parents are more controlling of daughters, especially early maturing girls, than they are of sons (Caspi et al., 1993). In addition, culture and ethnicity play a role in how restrictive parents are with the daily lives of their children (Chen et al., 2013).

#### Parent-Child Relationship

Having supportive, less conflict-ridden relationships benefits both parents and teenagers. Research on attachment in adolescence finds that teens who are still securely attached to their parents have fewer emotional problems (Rawatlal et al., 2015), are less likely to engage in drug abuse and other criminal behaviors (Meeus et al., 2004), and have more positive peer relationships (Shomaker & Furman, 2009).

### Peers 

As children become adolescents, they usually begin spending more time with their peers and less time with their families, and these peer interactions are increasingly unsupervised by adults. Children's notions of friendship often focus on shared activities, whereas adolescents' notions of friendship increasingly focus on intimate exchanges of thoughts and feelings.   
  
During adolescence, peer groups evolve from being primarily single-sex to mixed-sex. Adolescents within a peer group tend to be similar to one another in behavior and attitudes; that is, adolescents who are similar to one another choose to spend time together in a "birds of a feather flock together" kind of way; this tendency is called **homophily**. Adolescents who spend time together also shape each other's behaviors and attitudes.

#### Peer Influence

Peers can serve both positive and negative functions during adolescence. Negative peer pressure can lead adolescents to make riskier decisions or engage in more problematic behavior than they would alone or in the presence of their family. For example, adolescents are much more likely to drink alcohol, use drugs, and commit crimes when they are with their friends than when they are alone or with their family. One of the most widely studied aspects of adolescent peer influence is known as **deviant peer contagion** (Dishion & Tipsord, 2011), which is the process by which peers reinforce problem behavior by laughing or showing other signs of approval that then increase the likelihood of future problem behavior.

However, peers also serve as an important source of social support and companionship during adolescence, and adolescents with positive peer relationships are happier and better adjusted than those who are socially isolated or have conflictual peer relationships.

Crowds are an emerging level of peer relationships in adolescence. In contrast to friendships, which are reciprocal two-way relationships, and **cliques,** which refer to groups of individuals who interact frequently, **crowds** are characterized more by shared reputations or images than actual interactions (Brown & Larson, 2009). These crowds reflect different prototypic identities, such as "jocks" or "brains," and are often linked with adolescents' social status and peers' perceptions of their values or behaviors.

### Romantic Relationships 

Adolescence is the developmental period during which romantic relationships typically first emerge. By the end of adolescence, most American teens have had at least one romantic relationship (Dolgin, 2011). However, culture does play a role, as Asian Americans and Latinos are less likely to date than other ethnic groups (Connolly et al., 2004). Dating serves many purposes for teens, including fun, companionship, status, socialization, sexual experimentation, intimacy, and partner selection for those in late adolescence (Dolgin, 2011).

The same-sex peer groups that were common during childhood often expand into mixed-sex peer groups that are more characteristic of adolescence. Heterosexual romantic relationships often form in the context of these mixed-sex peer groups (Connolly et al., 2000). This is also a time when individuals who are not heterosexual—lesbian, gay, or bisexual adolescents—come to see and identify themselves as such (Russell et al., 2009).   
  
By middle adolescence, teens are engaging in brief, casual dating or in group dating with established couples (Dolgin, 2011). Then, in late adolescence, dating involves exclusive, intense relationships. These relationships tend to be long-lasting and continue for a year or longer, but they may also interfere with friendships. Although romantic relationships during adolescence are often short-lived, their importance should not be minimized. This is a domain in which adolescents experiment with new behaviors and identities and also connect in a very central way to their emerging sexuality.

Adolescents spend a great deal of time focused on romantic relationships, and their positive and negative emotions are more tied to romantic relationships, or lack thereof, than to friendships, family relationships, or school (Furman & Shaffer, 2003). Romantic relationships contribute to adolescents' identity formation, changes in family and peer relationships, and emotional and behavioral adjustment.   
  
However, a negative dating relationship can adversely affect an adolescent's development. Soller (2014) explored the link between relationship inauthenticity and mental health. **Relationship inauthenticity** refers to an incongruence between thoughts and feelings and the actions within a relationship. Desires to gain partner approval and demands in the relationship may negatively affect an adolescent's sense of authenticity. Soller found that relationship inauthenticity was positively correlated with poor mental health, including depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts, especially for females.

### Socioemotional Development in Adolescence 

Adolescence is known for the formation of personal and social identity. Adolescents must explore, test limits, become autonomous, and commit to an identity, a sense of self. Different roles, behaviors, and ideologies must be tried out to select an identity, and adolescents continue to refine their sense of self as they relate to others.

Erik Erikson referred to the task of the adolescent as one of identity vs. role confusion. Thus, in Erikson's view, an adolescent's main questions are "Who am I?" and "Who do I want to be?" Some adolescents adopt the values and roles with which their parents provide them; other teens develop identities that are in opposition to their parents but align with a peer group. This is common, as peer relationships become a central focus in adolescents' lives.

Adolescents tend to be rather egocentric**;** they often experience a self-conscious desire to feel important in peer groups and receive social acceptance. Because choices made during adolescence can influence later life, higher levels of self-awareness and self-control in mid-adolescence will contribute to better decisions during the transition to adulthood. Three general approaches to understanding identity development include self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem.

#### Self-Concept

Early in adolescence, cognitive developments result in greater self-awareness. This leads to greater awareness of others as well as one's own thoughts and judgments. Adolescents develop the ability to think about abstract, future possibilities and consider multiple possibilities at once. They can conceptualize multiple possible selves that they could become, as well as long-term possibilities and consequences of their choices. Adolescents can begin to qualify their traits when asked to describe themselves. **Differentiation** occurs as an adolescent recognizes and distinguishes the contextual factors that influence their own behavior and the perceptions of others. Differentiation becomes fully developed by mid-adolescence.

The recognition of inconsistencies in the self-concept is a common source of distress during these years; however, this distress may benefit adolescents by encouraging further development and refinement of their self-concept.

#### Sense of Identity

Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self that is stable across circumstances and includes past experiences and future goals. Erikson determined that "identity achievement" resolves the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their chosen identity. Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their membership in a group and then focus on a personal identity. 

#### Self-Esteem

Self-esteem consists of one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. In the United States, children who are raised female are often taught that their sense of self is highly linked to their relationships with others; therefore, many adolescent girls enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends. The most important function of friendship here is having someone who can provide social and moral support.

Children who are raised as male, on the other hand, are often taught to value such things as autonomy and independence; therefore, many adolescent boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. High self-esteem is often derived from their ability to successfully influence their friends.

### Psychological Changes

During puberty, adolescents experience changes in the levels of certain neurotransmitters (such as dopamine and serotonin) in the limbic system. This affects the way in which they experience emotions, typically making them more emotional than younger children and adults and more sensitive to rewards and stress. 

Other cognitive developments have an impact on identity formation as well. When adolescents are able to think abstractly and reason logically, they have an easier time exploring and contemplating possible identities. When adolescents have advanced cognitive development and maturity, they tend to resolve identity issues more easily than peers who are less cognitively developed.

#### Parental Relationships

As adolescents work to form their identities, they pull away from their parents, and the peer group becomes very important (Shanahan et al., 2007). Despite spending less time with their parents, the type of relationship that adolescents have with their parents still plays a significant role in identity formation. Warm and healthy parent-child relationships have been associated with positive child outcomes, such as better grades and fewer school-behavior problems, in the United States as well as in other countries (Hair et al., 2005).

When a solid and positive relationship exists, adolescents are more likely to feel freedom in exploring identity options. However, when the relationship is not as close or supportive or the adolescent fears rejection from the parent, the adolescent is more likely to feel less confident in forming a separate, personal identity.

### Lesson 12: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how children in middle childhood and adolescence respond differently to groups like family and peers as they adjust to ongoing physical and cognitive changes.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain how emotions influence behavior from middle childhood through adolescence.

### Peer Relationships

For children and adolescents, relationships with peers are of enormous importance. Understanding these dynamics can shed light not only on how children relate to one another but also to how these experiences influence their later lives. Experts have focused much attention on learning about these effects.

**Sociometric assessment** measures attraction between members of a group, such as a classroom of students. In sociometric assessment, children are asked to mention the three children they like to play with the most and those they do not like to play with. The number of times a child is nominated for each of the two categories (like, do not like) is tabulated.

- **Popular children** receive many votes in the "like" category and very few in the "do not like" category. Some popular children are nice and have good social skills. These **popular-prosocial** children tend to do well in school and are cooperative and friendly.   
  
**Popular-antisocial** children may gain popularity by acting tough or spreading rumors about others (Cillessen & Mayeux, 2004). 
- In contrast, **rejected children** receive more unfavorable votes and few favorable ones. Rejected children are sometimes excluded because they are **rejected-withdrawn.** These children are shy and withdrawn and are easy targets for bullies because they are unlikely to retaliate when belittled (Boulton, 1999).   
  
Other rejected children are **rejected-aggressive** and are ostracized because they are aggressive, loud, and confrontational. The rejected-aggressive children may be acting out of a feeling of insecurity. Unfortunately, their fear of rejection only leads to behavior that brings further rejection from other children. Children who are not accepted are more likely to experience conflict, lack confidence, and have trouble adjusting (Klima & Repetti, 2008; Schwartz et al., 2014).
- **Controversial children** are frequently mentioned in each category, with several children liking them and several placing them in the "do not like" category.
- **Neglected children** are rarely mentioned in either category.
- The **average child** has a few positive votes with very few negative ones (Asher & Hymel, 1981).

### Long-Term Consequences of Popularity

Childhood popularity researcher Mitch Prinstein has found that likability in childhood leads to positive outcomes throughout one's life (as cited in Reid, 2017). Adults who were accepted in childhood have stronger marriages and work relationships, earn more money, and have better health outcomes than those who were unpopular.

#### Unpopularity

Further, those who were unpopular as children experienced greater anxiety, depression, substance use, obesity, physical health problems, and suicide. Prinstein found that a significant consequence of unpopularity was that children were denied opportunities to build their social skills and negotiate complex interactions, thus contributing to their continued unpopularity. 

Further, biological effects can occur due to unpopularity, as social rejection can activate genes that lead to an inflammatory response.

### The Responsibilities of Families toward Children

In addition to providing food, shelter, and clothing, families are responsible for helping the child learn, relate to others, and have a confident sense of self. Hopefully, the family will provide a harmonious and stable environment for living. A good home environment is one in which the child's physical, cognitive, emotional, and social needs are adequately met. Sometimes families emphasize physical needs but ignore cognitive or emotional needs. Other times, families pay close attention to physical needs and academic requirements but may fail to nurture the child's friendships with peers or guide the child toward developing healthy relationships.1

One of the ways to assess the quality of family life is to consider the way each family accomplishes its basic responsibilities toward its children. Berger (2014) lists five family functions:

1. Providing food, clothing, and shelter

2. Encouraging learning

3. Developing self-esteem

4. Nurturing friendships with peers

5. Providing harmony and stability1

Parents might want to consider how it feels to live in the household as a child. The functions of families listed above can be fulfilled in a variety of family types—not just intact, two-parent households.1

### Living Arrangements

Certainly, the living arrangements of children have changed significantly over the years. In 1960, 92 percent of children resided with married parents, while only 5 percent had divorced or separated parents, and 1 percent resided with parents who had never been married. By 2008, 70 percent of children resided with married parents, 15 percent had divorced or separated parents, and 14 percent resided with parents who had never married (Pew Research Center, 2010). In 2017, only 65 percent of children lived with two married parents, while 32 percent (24 million children younger than 18) lived with an unmarried parent (Livingston, 2018). Some 3 percent of children were not living with any parents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau data.1

Most children in unmarried parent households in 2017 were living with a solo mother (21 percent), but a growing share were living with **cohabiting** parents (7 percent) or a sole father (4 percent). The increase in children living with solo or cohabiting parents was thought to be due to the overall declines in marriage and increases in divorce. Of concern is that living with only one parent was associated with a household's lower economic situation. Specifically, 30 percent of solo mothers, 17 percent of solo fathers, and 16 percent of families with a cohabiting couple lived in poverty. In contrast, only 8 percent of married couples lived below the poverty line (Livingston, 2018).1

For children living with same-sex parents, the findings showed a few differences.

- Of the 1.1 million same-sex couples in the United States, 14.7 percent had at least one child under 18 in their household, compared with 37.8 percent of opposite-sex couples. 
- Same-sex couples also tended to have smaller families. Among couples with children, 54.7 percent of same-sex couples only had one child, compared with 39.2 percent of opposite-sex couples.
- Same-sex parents were more likely to be female. In 2019, 22.5 percent of female same-sex couple households had children under 18 present, compared with 6.6 percent of male same-sex couple households. 2

### Build Employability Skills and Competence

The skills addressed in this section are valuable for all adults, and particularly so for anyone in or aspiring to a career in the health professions. These skills are: 

1. Identify expected growth and changes at all physical, cognitive, and psychosocial stages of development. 
2. Describe the impact emotional states have on one's physiological state, behavior, and attitudes.

In this section, you can demonstrate these skills by passing a final assessment that measures whether you have mastered the following competencies:

- Explain physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development from early adulthood to the end of life.
- Explain the influence of emotions on psychosocial development and behavior from early adulthood to the end of life.

### Prepare for the Assessment

To prepare for the competency objective assessment, ask yourself these questions:

- Can I identify physical changes from early adulthood to the end of life?
- Can I identify the milestones in cognitive development from early adulthood to the end of life?
- Can I identify the milestones in psychosocial development from early adulthood to the end of life?
- Can I describe how emotions influence psychosocial development and behavior from early adulthood to the end of life?

### Move Ahead if Ready

Are you ready to demonstrate your competency and skills?

If you answered yes to all the "Prepare for the Assessment" questions, begin this section by taking the Section 3 assessment. If you do well and are confident, take the Pre-Assessment. Use your results, or results from a prior pre-assessment attempt, to help gauge your readiness to take the objective assessment. If you plan to move ahead, discuss your plan with your instructor.

### Lesson 1: Introduction

A number of changes occur during the transition from adolescence to adulthood as an individual goes through multiple stages; during these stages, several factors affect the development of both mind and body. In this lesson, you will learn about the physical changes that mark the transition from adolescence to early adulthood.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain typical physical changes during early adulthood.

### Periods of Development

At one time, it was believed that people reached "adulthood" and then just continued life more or less without change for 40, 60, or 80 years. Experts in human development no longer believe that. In fact, individuals go through various periods of development during several stages of adulthood, classified as:

- **Emerging Adulthood:** The period of emerging adulthood is a transitional time between the end of adolescence and before individuals acquire all the benchmarks of adulthood. Continued identity exploration and preparation for full independence from parents are demonstrated. Although at one's physiological peak, emerging adults are most at risk for involvement in violent crimes and substance abuse.
- **Early Adulthood:** The mid-twenties and through mid-forties are identified as early adulthood. Intimate relationships, establishing families, and work are primary concerns at this stage of life.
- **Middle Adulthood:** The mid-forties through the mid-sixties is referred to as middle adulthood. This is a period in which aging becomes more noticeable and when many people are at their peak of productivity in love and work.
- **Late Adulthood:** Late adulthood is sometimes subdivided into two categories: The young-old who are from 65 to 84 years of age and the oldest-old who are 85 years and older. One of the primary differences between these groups is that the young-old are still relatively healthy, productive, active, and the majority continue to live independently. With both age groups, the risks of diseases such as arteriosclerosis, cancer, and cerebral vascular disease increases substantially.

### When Does Adulthood Begin?

According to Rankin and Kenyon (2008), historically the process of becoming an adult was more clearly marked by **rites of passage.** For many, marriage and parenthood were considered entry into adulthood. However, these role transitions are no longer considered the important markers of adulthood (Arnett, 2001).   
  
Economic and social changes have resulted in more young adults attending college (Rankin & Kenyon, 2008) and a delay in marriage and having children (Arnett & Taber, 1994; Laursen & Jensen-Campbell, 1999). Consequently, current research has found financial independence and accepting responsibility for oneself to be the most important markers of adulthood in Western culture across age (Arnett, 2001) and ethnic groups (Arnett, 2004).

In looking at college students' perceptions of adulthood, Rankin and Kenyon (2008) found that some students still view rites of passage as important markers. These college students who placed more importance on role transition markers such as parenthood and marriage were found to have one or more of these characteristics: belonged to a fraternity or a sorority, were traditionally aged (18 to 25), belonged to an ethnic minority, were of a traditional marital status (that is, not cohabitating), or belonged to a religious organization (particularly for men).   
  
These findings supported the view that people holding collectivist or more traditional values place more importance on role transitions as markers of adulthood. In contrast, older college students and those cohabitating did not value role transitions as markers of adulthood as strongly.

### The Physiological Peak

People in their mid-twenties to mid-forties are considered to be in early adulthood. By the time they reach early adulthood, physical maturation is complete, although height and weight may increase slightly. Those in their early twenties are probably at the peak of their physiological development by such measures as muscle strength, reaction time, sensory abilities, and cardiac functioning. The reproductive system, motor skills, strength, and lung capacity are all operating at their best. Most professional athletes are at the top of their game during this stage, and many women have children in the early-adulthood years (Boundless, 2016).

The aging process actually begins during early adulthood. Around the age of 30, many changes begin to occur in different parts of the body. For example, the lens of the eye starts to stiffen and thicken, resulting in changes in vision (usually affecting the ability to focus on close objects).

Sensitivity to sound decreases; this happens twice as quickly for men as for women. Hair can start to thin and become gray around the age of 35, although this may happen earlier for some individuals and later for others. The skin becomes drier and wrinkles start to appear by the end of early adulthood. People of this age see a decline in response time and the ability to recover quickly from physical exertion. The immune system also becomes less adept at fighting off illness, and reproductive capacity starts to decline (Boundless, 2016).

### Obesity

Although at the peak of physical health, a concern for early adults is the current rate of obesity. Results from the National Center for Health Statistics indicated that an estimated 70.7 percent of U.S. adults aged 20 and over were overweight in 2012 (CDC, 2015b) and by 2016, 39.8 percent were considered obese (Hales, Carroll, Fryar, & Ogden, 2017). **Body mass index** (BMI), expressed as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2), is commonly used to classify overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.9), obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30.0), and extreme **obesity** (BMI greater than or equal to 40.0).   
  
Current statistics from 2013-2014 indicated that an estimated 35.1 percent were obese and 6.4 percent, extremely obese (Fryar et al., 2014). The CDC also indicated that one's twenties are the prime time to gain weight as the average person gains one to two pounds per year from early adulthood into middle adulthood. The average man in his twenties weighs around 185 pounds and by his thirties, he weighs approximately 200 pounds. The average American woman weighs 162 pounds in her twenties and 170 pounds in her thirties.

The American obesity crisis is also reflected worldwide (Wighton, 2016). In 2014, global obesity rates for men were measured at 10.8 percent and among women, 14.9 percent. This translates to 266 million obese men and 375 million obese women in the world, and more people were identified as obese than underweight. Although obesity is seen throughout the world, more obese men and women live in China and the United States.

#### Causes of Obesity

According to the CDC (2016), obesity originates from a complex set of contributing factors, including one's environment, behavior, and genetics. Societal factors include culture, education, food marketing and promotion, the quality of food, and the physical activity environment available. Behaviors leading to obesity include diet, the amount of physical activity, and medication use.   
  
Please note that there does not appear to be a single gene responsible for obesity. Rather, research has identified variants in several genes that may contribute to obesity by increasing hunger and food intake. Another genetic explanation is the mismatch between today’s environment and "energy-thrifty genes" that multiplied in the distant past, when food sources were unpredictable. The genes that helped human ancestors survive occasional famines are now being challenged by environments in which food is plentiful all the time. Overall, obesity most likely results from complex interactions among the environment and multiple genes.

#### Obesity Health Consequences

Obesity is considered to be one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide. Additionally, the medical care costs of obesity in the United States were estimated to be $147 billion in 2008. According to the CDC (2016), people who are obese are at increased risk for many serious diseases and health conditions including:

- all causes of death (mortality) 
- high blood pressure (Hypertension)
- high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, or high levels of triglycerides (Dyslipidemia)
- Type 2 diabetes
- coronary heart disease
- stroke
- gallbladder disease
- osteoarthritis (a breakdown of cartilage and bone within a joint)
- sleep apnea and breathing problems
- some cancers (endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, and liver)
- low quality of life
- mental illness, such as clinical depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders
- body pain and difficulty with physical functioning

### A Healthy But Risky Time

Doctor's visits are less frequent in early adulthood than for those in midlife and late adulthood; they are often necessitated primarily by injury and pregnancy (Berger, 2005). However, the top five causes of death in emerging and early adulthood are non-intentional injury (including motor vehicle accidents), homicide, and suicide, with cancer and heart disease completing the list (Heron, & Smith, 2007).   
  
Rates of violent death (homicide, suicide, and accidents) are highest among young adult males and vary by race and ethnicity. Males are three times more likely to die in auto accidents than are females (Frieden, 2011). Rates of violent death are higher in the United States than in Canada, Mexico, Japan, and other selected countries. 

#### Alcohol Abuse

A significant contributing factor to risky behavior is alcohol. According to the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) (2016), 88 percent of people aged 18 or older reported that they drank alcohol at some point in their lifetime; 71 percent reported that they drank in the past year and 57 percent reported drinking in the past month.   
  
Additionally, 6.7 percent reported that they engaged in heavy drinking in the past month. Heavy drinking is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion on each of five or more days in the past 30 days. Nearly 88,000 people (approximately 62,000 men and 26,000 women) die from alcohol-related causes annually, making it the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States. In 2014, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities accounted for 9,967 deaths (31 percent of all driving fatalities).

The NIAAA defines **binge****drinking** as producing blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 gram per deciliter. This typically occurs after four drinks for women or five drinks for men in approximately two hours. In 2014, 25 percent of people aged 18 or older reported that they engaged in binge drinking in the past month. According to the NIAAA, "Binge drinking poses serious health and safety risks, including car crashes, drunk-driving arrests, sexual assaults, and injuries. Over the long term, frequent binge drinking can damage the liver and other organs" (2015, p. 1).

#### Alcohol and College Students

Results from the 2014 NIAAA survey demonstrated a difference between the amount of alcohol consumed by college students and those of the same age who are not in college (NIAAA, 2016). Specifically, 60 percent of full-time college students aged 18 to 22 drank alcohol in the past month, compared with 51.5 percent of other persons of the same age who were not in college. In addition, 38 percent of college students aged 18 to 22 engaged in binge drinking (five or more drinks on one occasion in the past month), compared with 33.5 percent of other persons of the same age. Lastly, 12 percent of college students (aged 18 to 22) engaged in heavy drinking (binge drinking on five or more occasions per month) in the past month. This compares with 9.5 percent of other emerging adults not in college.

The consequences for college drinking are staggering, and the NIAAA (2016) estimates that each year these things occur:

- 1,825 college students between the ages of 18 and 24 die from alcohol-related unintentional injuries, including motor-vehicle crashes.
- 696,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are assaulted by another student who has been drinking.
- Roughly 1 in 5 college students meet the criteria for an Alcohol Use Disorder.
- About 1 in 4 college students report academic consequences from drinking, including missing class, falling behind in class, doing poorly on exams or papers, and receiving lower grades overall. 
- 97,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 report experiencing alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape.

#### Alcohol Role

The role alcohol plays in predicting rape on college campuses is of particular concern. "Alcohol use is one of the strongest predictors of rape and sexual assault on college campuses" (Carroll, 2016, p. 454). Krebs et al. (2009) found that over 80 percent of sexual assaults on college campuses involved alcohol. Women and girls are more likely to falsely blame themselves and to be falsely blamed by others if they were intoxicated when raped. College students view perpetrators who were drinking as less responsible, and victims who were drinking as more responsible for the assaults (Untied, Orchowski, Mastroleo, & Gidycz, 2012).

#### Factors Affecting College Students Drinking

Several factors associated with college life affect a student's involvement with alcohol (NIAAA, 2015). These include the pervasive availability of alcohol, inconsistent enforcement of underage drinking laws, unstructured time, coping with stressors, and limited interactions with parents and other adults. Due to social pressures to conform and expectations when entering college, the first six weeks of freshman year are an especially susceptible time for students. Additionally, more drinking occurs in colleges with active Greek systems and athletic programs. Alcohol consumption is lowest among students living with their families and commuting, while it is highest among those living in fraternities and sororities.

#### College Strategies to Curb Drinking

Strategies to address college drinking involve both individuals and the campus community as a whole. Identifying at-risk groups, such as first-year students, members of fraternities and sororities, and athletes, has proven helpful in changing students' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior regarding alcohol (NIAAA, 2015). Interventions include education and awareness programs, as well as intervention by health professionals. At the college level, reducing the availability of alcohol has proven effective by decreasing both consumption and negative consequences.

### Non-Alcohol Substance Use

#### Illicit Drug Use

Illicit drug use peaks between the ages of 19 and 22 and then begins to decline. About 25 percent of those who smoke cigarettes, 33 percent of those who smoke marijuana, and 70 percent of those who abuse cocaine began using after age 17 (Volkow, 2004). Emerging adults (18 to 25) are the largest abusers of prescription opioid pain relievers, anti-anxiety medications, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medication (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2015). In 2016, opioid misuse within the past 12 months was reported by 3.6 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds and was twice as high among those 18 to 25 (Office of Adolescent Health, 2019). In 2014, more than 1,700 emerging adults died from a prescription **drug****overdose**. This is an increase of four times since 1999. Additionally, for every death, there were 119 more emergency room visits that did not result in death.

#### Marijuana Use

Daily marijuana use is at the highest level in three decades (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2015). For those in college, 2014 data indicates that 6 percent of college students smoke marijuana daily, while only 2 percent smoked daily in 1994. For non-college students of the same age, the daily percentage is twice as high (approximately 12 percent). Additionally, according to a recent survey by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (2018), daily cigarette smoking is lower for those in college in comparison to non-college groups.

Rates of violent death are influenced by substance use, which peaks during emerging and early adulthood. Drugs impair judgment, reduce inhibitions, and alter mood, all of which can lead to dangerous behavior. Reckless driving, violent altercations, and forced sexual encounters are some examples. Drug and alcohol use increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections because people are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior when under the influence. This includes having sex with someone who has had multiple partners, unprotected sex, having multiple partners, or having sex with someone whose history is unknown. Lastly, drugs and alcohol ingested during pregnancy have a teratogenic effect on the developing embryo and fetus.

### Key Term

- **drug overdose:** excessive intake of drugs beyond the recommended dosage

### Lesson 2: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about the physical changes that often occur as a person enters middle adulthood. These include both relatively trivial concerns such as hair loss and wrinkles and serious health conditions like diabetes and cancer.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain typical physical changes during middle adulthood.

### Middle Adulthood

Middle adulthood, or midlife, refers to the period of the lifespan between early adulthood and late adulthood. Although ages and tasks are culturally defined, the most common age definition is from 40 to 45 through 60 to 65. This may be the least studied time of the lifespan, and research on this developmental period is relatively new as many aspects of midlife are still being explored. In the United States, the large Baby Boom cohort (those born between 1946 and 1964) are now midlife adults (and some, late adults) and this has led to increased interest in this developmental stage. What is known is that this stage reflects both developmental gains and losses and that there are considerable individual differences; however, there is still much to learn about this age group.

### Age-Related Physical Changes

Each person experiences age-related physical changes differently, based on many factors. Biological factors such as molecular and cellular changes and **oxidative damage** are called **primary aging **factors. Aging that occurs due to controllable factors, such as an unhealthy lifestyle including lack of physical exercise and poor diet, is called **secondary aging** (Busse, 1969).   
  
These are some of the factors contributing to aging:

- tissue damage
- natural selection
- unhealthy lifestyle
- DNA modification
- oxidative damage
- drop in number of cells
- decline or loss of cellular function

Getting out of shape is not an inevitable part of aging; it is probably due to the fact that middle-aged adults become less physically active and experience greater stress. Smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, having a poor diet, stress, physical inactivity, and chronic disease such as diabetes or arthritis—all of these reduce overall health. However, adopting a healthier lifestyle can combat many of these changes.

### Physical Changes: Hair, Skin, Sarcopenia, and Lungs

#### Hair

When asked to imagine someone in middle adulthood, people often picture someone with the beginnings of wrinkles and gray or thinning hair. What accounts for these physical changes? Hair color is due to a pigment called **melanin**, which is produced by **hair follicles** (Martin, 2014). With aging, hair follicles produce less melanin, and this causes hair to become gray. Hair color typically starts turning lighter at the temples, but eventually all hair becomes white. For many, graying begins in the thirties, but it is largely determined by genes. For example, gray hair tends to occur earlier in people who are White than in people who are Asian.

Genes also determine how much hair remains on the head. Almost everyone has some hair loss with aging, and the rate of hair growth slows with aging. Many hair follicles stop producing new hairs and hair strands become smaller. Many men begin showing signs of balding by 30 and some are nearly bald by 60. Male-pattern baldness is often related to testosterone and is identified by a receding hairline followed by hair loss at the top of the head. Women can also develop female-patterned baldness as their hair becomes less dense and the scalp becomes visible (Martin, 2014). Sudden hair loss, however, can be a symptom of a health problem.

#### Skin

Skin continues to dry out as the adult ages and the skin is prone to more wrinkling, particularly on the sensitive face area. Wrinkles, which are creases in the skin, are a normal part of aging. As people get older, skin dries and loses the underlying layer of fat, so faces no longer appear as smooth. Loss of muscle tone and thinning skin can make the face appear flabby or drooping. Although wrinkles are a natural part of aging—and genetics plays a role here, too—frequent sun exposure and smoking cause wrinkles to appear sooner. Dark spots and blotchy skin also occur as one ages and are due to exposure to sunlight (Moskowitz, 2014). Blood vessels become more apparent as the skin continues to dry and get thinner.

#### Sarcopenia

The loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with aging is referred to as **sarcopenia **(Morley et al., 2001). Sarcopenia is thought to be a significant factor in the frailty and functional impairment that occurs when older. The decline of growth and anabolic hormones, especially testosterone, and decreased physical activity have been implicated as causes of sarcopenia (Proctor et al., 1998).   
  
The decline in muscle mass can occur as early as 40 years of age and contributes significantly to a decrease in life quality, increase in health care costs, and early death in older adults (Karakelides & Nair, 2005). Exercise is certainly important to increase strength, aerobic capacity, and muscle protein synthesis, but unfortunately it does not reverse all the age-related changes that occur. The muscle-to-fat ratio for both men and women also changes throughout middle adulthood, with an accumulation of fat in the stomach area.

#### Lungs

The lungs serve two functions: supply oxygen to the body and remove carbon dioxide from the body. Thinning of the bones with age can change the shape of the rib cage and result in a loss of lung expansion. Age-related changes in muscles, such as the weakening of the diaphragm, can also reduce lung capacity.   
  
Both of these changes lower oxygen levels in the blood and increase the levels of carbon dioxide. Experiencing shortness of breath and feeling tired can result (NIH, 2014). In middle adulthood, these changes and their effects are often minimal, especially in people who are non-smokers and physically active. However, in those with chronic bronchitis or who have experienced frequent pneumonia, asthma, other lung related disorders, or who are smokers, the effects of these normal age changes can be more pronounced.

- **melanin:** Melanin is a natural skin pigment. Melanin is produced through a multistage chemical process known as melanogenesis, where the oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine is followed by polymerization
- **hair follicles:** the sheath of cells and connective tissue which surrounds the root of a hair
- **sarcopenia :** a syndrome which causes loss of skeletal muscle mass and function

### Sensory Changes: Vision 

#### Presbyopia

A normal change of the eye due to age is **presbyopia**, which is Latin for "old vision." It refers to a loss of elasticity in the lens of the eye that makes it harder for the eye to focus on objects that are closer to the person.

When people look at something far away, the lens flattens out; when looking at nearby objects, tiny muscle fibers around the lens enable the eye to bend the lens. With age, these muscles weaken and can no longer accommodate the lens to focus the light. Anyone over the age of 35 is at risk for developing presbyopia.

According to the National Eye Institute (NEI) (2016), signs that someone may have presbyopia include:

-  hard time reading small print
-  having to hold reading material farther than arm’s distance
-  problems seeing objects that are close
-  headaches
-  eyestrain

#### Floaters

Another common eye problem people experience as they age are** floaters**, little spots or “cobwebs” that float around the field of vision. They are most noticeable if you are looking at the sky on a sunny day, or at a lighted blank screen. Floaters occur when the **vitreous body**, filled with a gel-like substance in the interior of the eye, slowly shrinks. As it shrinks, it becomes somewhat stringy, and these strands can cast tiny shadows on the retina.

In most cases, floaters are harmless, more of an annoyance than a sign of eye problems. However, floaters that appear suddenly, or that darken and obscure vision can be a sign of more serious eye problems, such as retinal tearing, infection, or inflammation. People who are very nearsighted, have diabetes, or who have had cataract surgery are also more likely to have floaters (NEI, 2009).

During midlife, adults may begin to notice a drop in **scotopic sensitivity**, the ability to see in dimmer light. By age 60, the retina receives only one-third as much light as it did at age 20, making working in dimmer light more difficult (Jackson & Owsley, 2000). Night vision is also affected as the pupil loses some of its ability to open and close to accommodate drastic changes in light. Eyes become more sensitive to glare from headlights and street lights making it difficult to see people and cars and movements outside of the direct line of sight (NIH, 2016).

#### Dry Eye Syndrome

Finally, some people experience** dry eye syndrome**, which occurs when the eye does not produce tears properly, or when the tears evaporate too quickly because they are not the correct consistency (NEI, 2013). While dry eye syndrome can affect people at any age, nearly five million Americans over the age of 50 experience dry eye. It affects women more than men, especially after menopause. Women who experienced an early menopause may be more likely to experience dry eye, which can cause surface damage to the eye.

### Hearing

Hearing problems increase during middle adulthood. According to a recent UK study (Dawes et al., 2014), the rate of hearing problems doubled between the ages of 40 and 55 and tripled by age 64. Similar statistics are found in U.S. samples of middle-aged adults. Prior to age 40, about 5.5 percent of adults report hearing problems. This jumps to 19 percent among 40- to 69-year-olds (American Psychological Association, 2016).   
  
Middle-aged adults may experience more problems understanding speech when in noisy environments, in comparison to younger adults (Füllgrabe et al., 2015; Neidleman et al., 2015). As people age, they also lose the ability to hear higher frequencies (Humes et al., 2010). Hearing changes are more common among men than women, but males may underestimate their hearing problems (Uchida et al., 2003).   
  
For many adults, hearing loss accumulates after years of being exposed to intense noise levels. Men are more likely to work in noisy occupations. Hearing loss is also exacerbated by cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke. Most hearing loss could be prevented by guarding against being exposed to extremely noisy environments.

### Health Concerns: Heart Disease

According to the most recent National Vital Statistics Reports (Kochanek et al., 2019), heart disease continues to be the number one cause of death for Americans. It claimed 23 percent of those who died in 2017. It is also the number one cause of death worldwide (World Health Organization, 2018). Heart disease develops slowly over time and typically appears in midlife (Hooker & Pressman, 2016). 

Heart disease can include heart defects and heart rhythm problems, as well as narrowed, blocked, or stiffened blood vessels referred to as **cardiovascular disease**. The blocked blood vessels prevent the body and heart from receiving adequate blood. **Atherosclerosis**, a buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, is the most common cause of cardiovascular disease. The plaque buildup thickens the artery walls and restricts the blood flow to organs and tissues. Cardiovascular disease can lead to a heart attack, chest pain, or stroke (Mayo Clinic, 2014).

### Symptoms of Cardiovascular Disease 

Symptoms of cardiovascular disease differ for men and women. Males are more likely to suffer chest pain, while women are more likely to demonstrate shortness of breath, nausea, and extreme fatigue. Symptoms can also include pain in the arms, legs, neck, jaw, throat, abdomen, and back (Mayo Clinic, 2014).

According to the Mayo Clinic (2014), there are many risk factors for developing heart disease, including medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity. Other risk factors include:

- **Advanced age:** increased risk for narrowed arteries and weakened or thickened heart muscle
- **Sex:** males are at greater risk, but a female's risk increases after menopause
- **Family history:** increased risk, especially if male parent or brother developed heart disease before age 55 or female parents or sister developed heart disease before age 65
- **Smoking:** Nicotine constricts blood vessels and carbon monoxide damages the inner linings of organs.
- **Poor diet:** a diet high in fat, salt, sugar, and cholesterol
- **Excessive alcohol consumption:** Alcohol can raise the level of bad fats in the blood and increase blood pressure.
- **Stress:** Unrelieved stress can damage arteries and worsen other risk factors.
- **Poor hygiene:** Establishing good hygiene habits can prevent viral or bacterial infections that can affect the heart. Poor dental care can also contribute to heart disease.

#### Complications of Heart Disease

Complications of heart disease can include heart failure (when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs) and a heart attack (when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the heart). Such a blockage can damage or destroy a part of the heart muscle, and atherosclerosis is a factor in a heart attack. Treatment for heart disease includes medication, surgery, and lifestyle changes including exercise, a healthy diet, and refraining from smoking.

**Sudden cardiac arrest** is the unexpected loss of heart functioning, breathing, and consciousness, often caused by an abnormal heartbeat. The heartbeat may be too quick, too slow, or irregular. With a healthy heart, it is unlikely for a fatal cardiac arrest to develop without an outside factor, such as an electric shock or illegal drugs. If not treated immediately, sudden cardiac arrest can be fatal and result in death.

### Health Concerns: Cancer

After heart disease, **cancer **was the second leading cause of death for Americans in 2017 as it accounted for 21.3 percent of all deaths (Xu et al., 2016). According to the National Institutes of Health (2015), cancer is the name given to a collection of related diseases in which the body's cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues. These extra cells can divide and form growths called tumors, which are typically masses of tissue.

Cancerous tumors are malignant, which means they can invade nearby tissues. When removed, **malignant tumors** may grow back. Unlike malignant tumors, benign tumors do not invade nearby tissues. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large and when removed usually do not grow back. Although benign tumors in the body are not cancerous, benign brain tumors can be life-threatening.

Cancer cells can prompt nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply the tumors with oxygen and nutrients, which allows them to grow. These blood vessels also remove waste products from the tumors. Cancer cells can also hide from the immune system, a network of organs, tissues, and specialized cells that protects the body from infections and other conditions. Lastly, cancer cells can metastasize, which means they can break from where they first formed, called the primary cancer, and travel through the lymph system or blood to form new tumors in other parts of the body. This new metastatic tumor is the same type as the primary tumor (National Institutes of Health, 2015). This image shows cancer in the lungs.

#### Cancer Development

Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body. While normal cells mature into very distinct cell types with specific functions, cancer cells do not; they continue to divide without stopping. Further, cancer cells are able to ignore the signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or to begin a process known as "programmed cell death," which the body uses to get rid of unneeded cells. With the growth of cancer cells, normal cells are crowded out and the body is unable to work the way it is supposed to. For example, the cancer cells in lung cancer form tumors that interfere with the functioning of the lungs and how oxygen is transported to the rest of the body.

### Cancer Types

There are more than 100 types of cancer. The American Cancer Society assembles a list of the most common types of cancers in the United States. To qualify for the 2016 list, the estimated annual incidence had to be 40,000 cases or more. The most common type of cancer on the list is breast cancer, with the next most common, lung cancer and prostate cancer. This table lists the estimated number of new cases and deaths for each common cancer type for 2019 (American Cancer Society, 2019).

- **cancer: **general name for a group of related diseases in which cells divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues, damaging the body's functioning

### Health Concerns: Diabetes

**Diabetes mellitus** is a disease in which the body does not control the amount of glucose in the blood. This disease occurs when the body does not make enough **insulin **or does not use it the way it should (NIH, 2016). Insulin is a type of hormone that helps glucose in the blood enter cells to give them energy. In adults, 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed cases of diabetes are Type 2 (American Diabetes Association [ADA], 2016).   
  
Type 2 diabetes usually begins with **insulin resistance**, a disorder in which the cells in the muscles, liver, and fatty tissue do not use insulin properly (CDC, 2014). As the need for insulin increases, cells in the pancreas gradually lose the ability to produce enough insulin. In some Type 2 diabetics, pancreatic beta cells will cease functioning, and the need for insulin injections will become necessary.   
  
Some people with diabetes experience substantial insulin resistance with only minor dysfunction of the pancreas. Other diabetics experience only slight insulin resistance, with the primary cause being a lack of insulin secretion (CDC, 2014).

One in three adults are estimated to have **prediabetes**, and nine out of ten of them do not know. According to the CDC (2014), without intervention, 15 to 30 percent of people with prediabetes will develop diabetes within five years. In 2015, 30.2 million people (9.4 percent of the population) were living with diabetes in America, mostly adults age 18 and up (CDC, 2017).   
  
This table shows the numbers of adults, in millions, by age and gender, with both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. The median age of diagnosis is 54 (CDC, 2014). During middle adulthood, the number of people with diabetes dramatically increases; with 4.3 million living with diabetes prior to age 45, to over 13 million between the ages of 45 to 64; a four-fold increase. Men are slightly more likely to experience diabetes than women.

### Ethnic Differences in Diabetic Diagnosis

Diabetes also affects ethnic and racial groups differently. Non-Hispanic Whites are less likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than Asian Americans, Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives. However, these general figures hide the variations within these groups.   
  
For instance, the rate of diabetes was less for Central Americans, South Americans, and Cuban Americans than for Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans, and less for Alaskan Natives than the American Indians of Southern Arizona (CDC, 2017). Additionally, educational attainment, which is linked to one's economic level, is correlated with diabetes. People with less than a high school diploma have the highest incidence of diabetes among the three groups (21.6 percent); those with a high school degree have a much lesser degree of incidence (9.5 percent); and those with education beyond high school have the least (7.2 percent).

The risk factors for diabetes include:

- over age 45
- obesity
- family history of diabetes
- history of gestational diabetes 
- race and ethnicity
- physical inactivity
- diet

#### Diabetes Health Complications

Diabetes has been linked to numerous health complications. Adults with diabetes are 1.7 times more likely to have cardiovascular disease, 1.8 times more likely to experience a heart attack, and 1.5 times more likely to experience stroke than adults without diabetes. Diabetes can cause blindness and other eye problems. Between 40 and 45 percent of Americans with diabetes have some degree of **diabetic retinopathy**, which is damage to the small blood vessels in the retina that may lead to loss of vision (NEI, 2015). More than 4 percent showed advanced diabetic retinopathy.

Diabetes is linked as the primary cause of almost half of new cases of kidney failure each year. About 60 percent of non-traumatic limb amputations occur in people with diabetes. Diabetes has been linked to hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), gum disease, and neuropathy (nerve disease) (CDC, 2014).

### Diabetes Tests

Typical tests for diabetes include a fasting **glucose **test and the **A1C **test. Fasting glucose levels should be under 100 milligrams per deciliter (ADA, 2016). The A1C test provides information about the average levels of blood glucose over the last three months (NIH, 2014). The A1C should be under 5.7, where 5.0 = 97 milligrams per deciliter and 6.0 = 126 milligrams per deciliter (ADA, 2016).

### Health Concerns: Metabolic Syndrome

**Metabolic syndrome** is a cluster of several **cardiometabolic** risk factors, including large waist circumference; high blood pressure; and elevated triglycerides, LDL, and blood glucose levels. Metabolic syndrome can lead to diabetes and heart disease (Crist et al., 2012). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the United States is approximately 34 percent of the population and is especially high among Hispanics and African Americans (Ford, Li, & Zhao, 2010).

Prevalence increases with age, peaking in one's sixties (Ford et al., 2010). Metabolic syndrome increases the severity of cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Hu et al., 2004; Malik, 2004). Hu and colleagues found that even having one or two of the risk factors for metabolic syndrome increased the risk of mortality. Crist et al. (2012) found that increasing aerobic activity and reducing weight led to a drop in many of the risk factors of metabolic syndrome, including a reduction in waist circumference and blood pressure, and an increase in HDL cholesterol.

### Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

**Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)** is an inflammatory disease that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints (NIH, 2016). RA occurs when the immune system attacks the membrane lining the joints. RA is the second most common form of arthritis after **osteoarthritis**, which is the normal wear and tear on the joints.

Unlike osteoarthritis, RA is symmetric in its attack of the body, thus, if one shoulder is affected, so is the other. In addition, those with RA may experience fatigue and fever. Below are the common features of RA (NIH, 2016).  
  
Features of Rheumatoid Arthritis

- Tender, warm, swollen joints
- Symmetrical pattern of affected joints
- Joint inflammation often affecting the wrist and finger joints closest to the hand
- Joint inflammation sometimes affecting other joints, including the neck, shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, ankles, and feet
- Fatigue, occasional fevers, a loss of energy
- Pain and stiffness lasting for more than 30 minutes in the morning or after a long rest
- Symptoms that last for many years
- Variability of symptoms among people with the disease.

About 1.5 million people (approximately 0.6 percent) of Americans experience RA. It occurs across all races and age groups, although the disease often begins in middle adulthood and occurs with increased frequency in older people. Like some other forms of arthritis, RA occurs much more frequently in women than in men. About two to three times as many women as men have the disease (NIH, 2016). The lifetime risk for RA for women is 3.6 percent and 1.7 percent for men (Crowson, et al., 2011).

#### Genes and Rheumatoid Arthritis 

Genes play a role in the development of RA. However, individual genes by themselves confer only a small risk of developing the disease, as some people who have these particular genes never develop RA. Scientists think that something must occur to trigger the disease process in people whose genetic makeup makes them susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis. For instance, some scientists also think hormonal factors may be involved.   
  
In women who experience RA, the symptoms may improve during pregnancy and flare after pregnancy. Women who use oral contraceptives may increase their likelihood of developing RA. This suggests hormones, or possibly deficiencies or changes in certain hormones, may increase the risk of developing RA in a genetically susceptible person (NIH, 2016).

Rheumatoid arthritis can affect virtually every area of a person’s life, and it can interfere with the joys and responsibilities of work and family life. Fortunately, current treatment strategies allow most people with RA to lead active and productive lives. Pain-relieving drugs and medications can slow joint damage and establishing a balance between rest and exercise can also lessen the symptoms of RA (NIH, 2016).

### Fatty Liver Disease

Fatty liver disease refers to the accumulation of fat in the liver. The liver normally contains little fat, and anything below 5 percent of liver weight is considered normal. This disease is present in 33 percent of American adults. In the past, the main cause of fat accumulation in the liver was due to excessive alcohol consumption, often eventually leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Today, increased caloric intake, especially resulting in obesity, and little physical activity are the main causes. Mild to moderate levels of fatty liver disease can be reversed through healthy lifestyle changes (Nassir, Rector, Hammoud, & Ibdah, 2015).

### Health Concerns: Sleep 

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (Kasper, 2015), adults require at least seven hours of sleep per night to avoid the health risks associated with chronic sleep deprivation. Less than six hours and more than 10 hours are also not recommended for those in middle adulthood (National Sleep Foundation, 2015). Not surprisingly, many Americans do not receive the seven to nine hours of sleep recommended. In 2013, only 59 percent of U.S. adults met that standard, while in 1942, 84 percent did (Jones, 2013).   
  
This means 41 percent of Americans receive less than the recommended amount of nightly sleep. Additional results included that in 1993, 67 percent of Americans felt they were getting enough sleep, but in 2013 only 56 percent felt they received as much sleep as needed. Additionally, 43 percent of Americans in 2013 believed they would feel better with more sleep.

#### Sleep Problems

According to the Sleep in America poll (National Sleep Foundation, 2015), 9 percent of Americans report being diagnosed with a sleep disorder and of those, 71 percent have **sleep apnea** and 24 percent suffer from **insomnia**. Pain is also a contributing factor in the difference between the amount of sleep Americans say they need and the amount they are getting. An average of 42 minutes of sleep debt occurs for those with chronic pain, and 14 minutes for those who have suffered from acute pain in the past week.   
  
Stress and overall poor health are also key components of shorter sleep durations and worse sleep quality. Those in midlife with lower life satisfaction experienced greater delay in the onset of sleep than those with higher life satisfaction. Delayed onset of sleep could be the result of worry and anxiety during midlife, and improvements in those areas should improve sleep. Lastly, menopause can affect a woman’s sleep duration and quality (National Sleep Foundation, 2016).

#### Children in the Home and Sleep

As expected, having children at home affects the amount of sleep one receives. According to a 2016 National Center for Health Statistics analysis (CDC, 2016), having children decreases the amount of sleep an individual receives, however, having a partner can improve the amount of sleep for both males and females.

#### Negative Consequences of Insufficient Sleep

There are many consequences of too little sleep, and they include physical, cognitive, and emotional changes. Sleep deprivation suppresses immune responses that fight off infection and can lead to obesity, memory impairment, and hypertension (Ferrie et al., 2007; Kushida, 2005). Insufficient sleep is linked to an increased risk for colon cancer, breast cancer, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes (Pattison, 2015). A lack of sleep can increase stress as **cortisol **(a stress hormone) remains elevated, which keeps the body in a state of alertness and hyperarousal that increases blood pressure.

Sleep is also associated with longevity. Dew et al. (2003) found that older adults who had better sleep patterns also lived longer. During deep sleep, a growth hormone is released that stimulates protein synthesis and cell division and breaks down fat that supplies energy. Consequently, a decrease in deep sleep contributes to less growth hormone being released and subsequent physical decline seen in aging (Pattison, 2015).

Sleep disturbances can also impair glucose functioning in middle adulthood. Caucasian, African American, and Chinese non-shift-working women aged 48 to 58 years who were not taking insulin-related medications participated in the Study of Women's Health across the Nation (SWAN) Sleep Study and were subsequently examined approximately five years later (Taylor et al., 2016). Body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance were measured at two time points.

Results indicated that irregular sleep schedules, including highly variable bedtimes and staying up much later than usual, are associated in midlife women with insulin resistance, which is an important indicator of metabolic health, including diabetes risk. Diabetes risk increases in midlife women, and irregular sleep schedules may be an important reason because irregular bedtime schedules expose the body to varying levels of light, which is the most important timing cue for the body's **circadian timing.** Disrupting circadian timing may impair glucose metabolism and energy stability.

### Exercise, Nutrition, and Weight

#### The Impact of Exercise

Exercise is a powerful way to combat the changes associated with aging. Exercise builds muscle, increases **metabolism**, helps control blood sugar, increases bone density, and relieves stress. Unfortunately, fewer than half of midlife adults exercise and only about 20 percent exercise frequently and strenuously enough to achieve health benefits. Many stop exercising soon after they begin an exercise program, particularly those who are very overweight. Exercise is particularly helpful in reducing stress in midlife and can be thought of as preventive health care. The best exercise programs are those that are engaged in regularly, regardless of the activity.   
  
A well-rounded program that is easy to follow includes walking and weight training. Having a safe, enjoyable place to walk can make the difference in whether or not someone walks regularly. Weight lifting and stretching exercises at home can also be part of an effective program. Walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming can release the tension caused by stressors. Learning relaxation techniques can also have healthful benefits. Promoting exercise for the 78 million "baby boomers" may be one of the best ways to reduce health care costs and improve quality of life (Shure & Cahan, 1998).

According to the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (2008), these are exercise guidelines for adults:

- adults should avoid being inactive; any activity will result in some health benefits
- for substantial health benefits, adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity exercise OR at least 75 minutes of vigorous intensity **aerobic **activity; aerobic activity should occur for at least 10 minutes and preferably spread throughout the week
- for more extensive health benefits, adults can increase their aerobic activity to 300 minutes per week of moderate intensity OR 150 minutes per week of vigorous intensity aerobic activity
- adults should also participate in muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate or high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on two or more days per week

### Nutritional Concerns

Aging brings about a reduction in the number of calories a person requires. This table shows estimated caloric needs in middle-aged adults. Many Americans respond to weight gain by dieting. However, eating less does not typically mean eating right, and people often suffer vitamin and mineral deficiencies as a result. All adults need to be especially aware of the amount of sodium, sugar, and fat they are ingesting.

#### S3, L2.9 Table Estimated Calorie Needs per Day, by Age, Sex, & Physical Activity Level

[a]Sedentary means a lifestyle that includes only the physical activity of independent living.

[b]Moderate activity means a lifestyle that includes physical activity equivalent to walking more than 1.5 to 3 miles per day at 3 or 4 miles per hours, in addition to the activities of independent living.

[c]Activity means a lifestyle that includes physical activity of walking 3 miles per day at 3 or 4 miles per hour, in addition to the activities of independent living.

[d]Estimates for females do not include women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  
  
**Excess Sodium**

According to dietary guidelines, adults should consume less than 2,300 milligrams (1 teaspoon) per day of sodium. The American Heart Association (2016) reports that the average sodium intake among Americans is 3,440 milligrams per day. Processed foods are the main culprits of excess sodium. High sodium levels in the diet is correlated with increased blood pressure, and its reduction does show corresponding drops in blood pressure. Adults with high blood pressure are strongly encouraged to reduce their sodium intake to 1,500 milligrams (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services & U.S. Department of Agriculture (USHHS & USDA), 2015).

#### **Excess Fat**

Dietary guidelines also suggest that adults should consume less than 10 percent of calories per day from saturated fats. The American Heart Association (2016) says optimally they should aim for a dietary pattern that achieves 5 to 6 percent of calories from saturated fat. In a 2,000-calorie diet, that is about 120 calories from saturated fat. In the average American diet, about 34.3 percent of the diet comes from fat, with 15 percent from saturated fat (Berglund et al., 1999). Diets high in fat not only contribute to weight gain but have been linked to heart disease, stroke, and high cholesterol.

#### **Added Sugar**

According to the recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans (USHHS & USDA, 2015), eating healthy means adults should consume less than 10 percent of calories per day from added sugars. Yet, currently about 15 percent of the calories in the American adult diet come from added sugars, which is equivalent to about 22 teaspoons of sugar per day (NIH, 2014). Excess sugar not only contributes to weight gain but also diabetes and other health problems.

#### **Metabolism and Weight Gain**

One of the common complaints of midlife adults is weight gain, especially the accumulation of fat in the abdomen, which is often referred to as the middle-aged spread (Lachman, 2004). Men tend to gain fat on their upper abdomen and back, while women tend to gain more fat on their waist and upper arms. Many adults are surprised at this weight gain because their diets have not changed; however, their metabolism has slowed during midlife. Metabolism is the process by which the body converts food and drink into energy. The calories consumed are combined with oxygen to release the energy needed to function (Mayo Clinic, 2014). People who have more muscle burn more calories, even at rest, and thus have a higher metabolism.

However, as people get older, the amount of muscle decreases. Consequently, fat accounts for more of one's weight in midlife, and fat slows down the number of calories burned. To compensate, midlife adults have to increase their level of exercise, eat less, and watch their nutrition to maintain their earlier physique.

Overview

Read this to learn about the climacteric phase when fertility declines; you will also learn how this phase of life is both biologically based and impacted by the environment.

### The Climacteric

The **climacteric,** the midlife transition when fertility declines, is biologically based but also impacted by the environment. During midlife, men *may *experience a reduction in their ability to reproduce. Women, however, lose their ability to reproduce once they reach menopause.

**Female Sexual and Reproductive Health**

**Perimenopause** refers to a period of transition in which a woman's ovaries stop releasing eggs and the level of estrogen and progesterone production decreases. **Menopause** is defined as 12 months without menstruation. The average age of menopause in the United States is approximately 51, however, many women begin experiencing symptoms in their forties. These symptoms occur during perimenopause, which can occur two to eight years before menopause (Huang, 2007). A woman may first begin to notice that her periods are more or less frequent than before. After a year without menstruation, a woman is considered menopausal and no longer capable of reproduction.

#### Symptoms

The symptoms that occur during perimenopause and menopause are typically caused by the decreased production of estrogen and progesterone (North American Menopause Society, 2016). The shifting hormones can contribute to the inability to fall asleep. Additionally, the declining levels of estrogen may make a woman more susceptible to environmental factors and stressors which disrupt sleep. A hot flash is a surge of adrenaline that can awaken the brain from sleep. It often produces sweat and a change of temperature that can be disruptive to sleep and comfort levels. Unfortunately, it may take time for adrenaline to recede and allow sleep to occur again (National Sleep Foundation, 2016).

The loss of estrogen also affects vaginal lubrication, which diminishes and becomes more watery and can contribute to pain during intercourse. The vaginal wall also becomes thinner and less elastic. Estrogen is also important for bone formation and growth, and decreased estrogen can cause osteoporosis resulting in decreased bone mass. Depression, irritability, and weight gain are often associated with menopause (Avis, Stellato & Crawford, 2001; Rossi, 2004). Weight gain can occur due to an increase in intra-abdominal fat followed by a loss of lean body mass after menopause (Morita et al., 2006). Consequently, women may need to change their lifestyle to counter any weight gain. Depression and mood swings are more common during menopause in women who have prior histories of these conditions rather than those who have not.

Additionally, the incidence of depression and mood swings is not greater among menopausal women than non-menopausal women. There are symptoms experienced by women during menopause, however, women vary greatly in the extent to which these symptoms are experienced. Most American women go through menopause with few problems (Carroll, 2016). Overall, menopause is not seen as universally distressing (Lachman, 2004).

#### Hormone Replacement Therapy

Concerns about the effects of hormone replacement have changed the frequency with which estrogen replacement and hormone replacement therapies have been prescribed for menopausal women. Estrogen replacement therapy was once commonly used to treat menopausal symptoms. However, more recently, hormone replacement therapy has been associated with breast cancer, stroke, and the development of blood clots (NIH, 2007).   
  
Most women do not have symptoms severe enough to warrant estrogen or hormone replacement therapy. If so, they can be treated with lower doses of estrogen and monitored with more frequent breast and pelvic exams. There are also some other ways to reduce symptoms. These include avoiding caffeine and alcohol, eating soy, remaining sexually active, practicing relaxation techniques, and using water-based lubricants during intercourse.

#### Menopause and Ethnicity

In a review of studies that mentioned menopause, symptoms varied greatly across countries, geographic regions, and even across ethnic groups within the same region (Palacios, Henderson, & Siseles, 2010). For example, the Study of Women's Health across the Nation (SWAN) examined 14,906 White, African American, Hispanic, Japanese American, and Chinese American women's menopausal experiences (Avis et al., 2001).   
  
After controlling for age, educational level, general health status, and economic stressors, White women were more likely to disclose symptoms of depression, irritability, forgetfulness, and headaches compared to women in the other racial/ethnic groups. African American women experienced more night sweats, but this varied across research sites. Finally, Chinese American and Japanese American reported fewer menopausal symptoms when compared to the women in the other groups. Overall, the Chinese and Japanese group reported the fewest symptoms, while White women reported more mental health symptoms and African American women reported more physical symptoms.

### Lesson 3: Introduction

"Once you reach adulthood, what next?” This common question forms the foundation for this lesson, which addresses normal physical changes that a person faces during late adulthood and toward the end of life. You will look at the different age categories in late adulthood and trace the differences between life expectancy and life span. 

In this lesson, you will look at the physical and sensory changes a person undergoes when entering late adulthood.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain typical physical changes during late adulthood to the end of life.

### The Stages of Late Adulthood

#### Overview of Late Adulthood

While anyone above the age of 65 is a senior adult, a 65-year-old person is very different from an 85-year-old person due to various age-related physical and sensory changes. This table displays the age periods of late adulthood.

#### Table S3, L3.1 Age Periods of Late Adulthood
**Age Period****Description**Young-oldStarts at 65 until 74Old-oldStarts at 75 until 84Oldest-oldStarts at 85 until 99CentenariansStarts at 100 onward
### About the Young-Old

Generally, this age span includes many positive aspects and is considered the “golden years” of adulthood. When compared to those who are older, the young-old experience relatively good health and social engagement (Smith, 2000), knowledge and expertise (Singer et al., 2003), and adaptive flexibility in daily living (Riediger et al., 2005).

#### Identifying the Young-Old

The young-old also show strong performance in attention, memory, and crystallized intelligence. In fact, those identified as young-old are more similar to those in midlife. This group is less likely to require long-term care, to be dependent or poor, and more likely to be married, working for pleasure rather than income, and living independently. Overall, those in this age period feel a sense of happiness and emotional well-being that is better than at any other period of adulthood (Carstensen et al., 2003; George, 2009; Robins & Trzesniewski, 2005). It is also an unusual age in that people are considered both in old age and *not *in old age (Rubinstein, 2002).

### About the Old-Old

Adults in this age period are likely to be living independently, but they often experience physical impairments as chronic diseases increase after age 75. For example, congestive heart failure is 10 times more common in people 75 and older than in younger adults (National Library of Medicine, 2019). In fact, half of all cases of heart failure occur in people after age 75 (Strait & Lakatta, 2012). In addition, hypertension and cancer rates are also more common after 75, but because they are linked to lifestyle choices, they typically can be prevented, lessened, or managed (Barnes, 2011b).

#### Oldest-Old

This age group often includes people who have more serious chronic ailments among the older adult population. In the United States, the oldest-old represented 14 percent of the older adult population in 2015 (He et al., 2016). This age group is one of the fastest-growing worldwide and is projected to increase more than 300 percent over its current levels (NIA, 2015b). The oldest-old are projected to be nearly 18 million by 2050, or about 4.5 percent of the U. S. population, compared with less than 2 percent of the population today. Females comprise more than 60 percent of those 85 and older, but they also suffer from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than older males (Gatz et al., 2016).

While this age group accounts for only 2 percent of the U. S. population, it accounts for 9 percent of all hospitalizations (Levant et al., 2015). In a study of over 64,000 patients aged 65 and older who visited an emergency department, the admission rates increased with age. Thirty-five percent of admissions after an emergency room visit were the young-old; almost 43 percent were the old-old; and nearly half were the oldest-old (Lee et al., 2018).   
  
The mortality rate was also higher with age. The most common reasons for hospitalization for the oldest-old were congestive heart failure, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, septicemia, stroke, and hip fractures. In recent years, hospitalizations for many of these medical problems have been reduced. However, hospitalization for urinary tract infections and septicemia has increased for those 85 and older (Levant et al., 2015).   
  
Those 85 and older are more likely to require long-term care and to be in nursing homes than the youngest-old. Almost 50 percent of the oldest-old require some assistance with daily living activities (APA, 2016). However, most still live in the community rather than a nursing home. The oldest-old are less likely to be married and living with a spouse compared with the majority of the young-old (APA, 2016; Stepler, 2016c).

### Categories of Centenarians

A segment of the oldest-old are centenarians—that is, 100 and older—and some are also referred to as supercentenarians—those 110 and older (Wilcox, Wilcox & Ferrucci, 2008). In 2015 there were nearly half a million centenarians worldwide, and it is estimated that this age group will grow to almost 3.7 million by 2050. The United States has the most centenarians, but Japan and Italy have the most relative to their total populations (Stepler, 2016e).

#### Identifying the Centenarians

Most centenarians tended to be healthier than many of their peers as they were growing older, and often there was a delay in the onset of any serious disease or disability until their nineties. A quarter reached 100 with no serious chronic illnesses such as depression, osteoporosis, heart disease, respiratory illness, or dementia (Ash et al. 2015). Centenarians are more likely to experience a rapid terminal decline in later life, meaning that for most of their adulthood, and even older adult years, they are relatively healthy in comparison to many other older adults (Ash et al., 2015; Wilcox et al., 2008).

### Life Expectancy vs. Life Span

**Maximum life span** is defined as the greatest age reached by any member of a given population (or species). For humans, maximum life span is currently between 120 and 125 years.  
  
**Life expectancy** is defined as the average number of years that members of a population (or species) live. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2019), global life expectancy for people born in the United States in 2019 is 72 years, with females reaching 74.2 years and males reaching 69.8 years. It can be inferred that women live longer than men around the world, with the gap between the sexes remaining about the same since 1990. Overall, life expectancy ranges from 61.2 years in low-income countries in the WHO African Region to 77.5 years in high-income countries in the WHO European Region.

#### World Healthy Life Expectancy

To understand the diversity of people in late adulthood, it is necessary to examine how well each individual is aging. Some people in late adulthood enjoy better health and social well-being than average and age at an optimal level. In contrast, others experience poor health and dependence to a greater extent than would be considered normal.

When looking at large populations, the WHO (2019) measures how many equivalent years of full health on average a newborn baby is expected to have. This age takes into account current age-specific mortality, morbidity, and disability risks and is referred to as the **Healthy Life Expectancy**.

In 2016, the global Healthy Life Expectancy was 63.3 years, up from 58.5 years in 2000. The WHO African Region had the lowest Healthy Life Expectancy at 53.8 years, while the WHO Western Pacific Region had the highest at 68.9 years.

### American Life Expectancy Through the Years

The overall life expectancy for a baby born in 2017 in the United States is 78.6 years, decreasing from 78.7 years in 2016 and 78.8 years in 2015. 

This graph shows the United States life expectancy for 2006 to 2017 by ethnicity and sex. It indicates that the decrease in life expectancy in males, which in 2016 went from 76.2 years to 76.1 years, while it did not change for females (81.1 years). Life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.1 year for the non-Hispanic White population (78.6 to 78.5 years). Life expectancy at birth did not change from 2016 for the non-Hispanic Black population (74.9 years) and the Hispanic population (81.8 years).
[Opens in new tab](https://assets.wgu.edu/7627873b7a5b32130289af74a66462ca)Image description
The overall life expectancy for a baby born in 2017 in the United States is 78.6 years, decreasing from 78.7 years in 2016 and 78.8 years in 2015 (Arias & Xu, 2019). The decrease from 2016 occurred for males, changing from 76.2 years to 76.1 years, while it did not change for females (81.1 years). Life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.1 year for the non-Hispanic white population (78.6 to 78.5). Life expectancy at birth did not change from 2016 for the non-Hispanic black population (74.9), and the Hispanic population (81.8). Before this two-year decline, life expectancy had been increasing. Reasons given by the CDC for this decrease in life expectancy include deaths from drug overdoses, an increase in liver disease, and a rise in suicide rates (Saiidi, 2019).Lally, M., and Valentine-French, S. (2019). [Lifespan development: A psychological perspective, 2nd ed.Opens in new tab](http://dept.clcillinois.edu/psy/LifespanDevelopment.pdf)
### American Healthy Life Expectancy

To determine the current United States Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE), factors were evaluated in 2007 through 2009 to determine how long an individual currently at age 65 will continue to experience good health (CDC, 2013). The highest Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) was observed in Hawaii with 16.2 years of additional good health, and the lowest was in Mississippi with only 10.8 years of additional good health.

#### Analysis

Although improvements have occurred in overall life expectancy, children born in America today may have a shorter lifespan than their parents. Much of this decline has been attributed to the increase in sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Since 1980, the obesity rate for children between 2 and 19 years old has tripled, as 20.5 percent of children were obese in 2014 compared with 5 percent in 1980 (American Medical Association, 2016).   
  
Obesity in children is associated with many health problems, including high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, elevated blood cholesterol levels, and psychological concerns including low self-esteem, negative body image, and depression. Excess weight is associated with an earlier risk of obesity-related diseases and death.

### The Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging

The Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) (NIA, 2011b) began in 1958 and has traced the aging process in 1,400 people from age 20 to 90. 

### Key Observations

Researchers from the BLSA have found that the aging process varies significantly from individual to individual and from one organ system to another. (A "longitudinal study" is one in which researchers follow a group of subjects over a period of time, looking for changes on what can be a broad range of measures.) However, some key generalizations can be made including: 

- heart muscles thicken with age 
- arteries become less flexible 
- lung capacity diminishes 
- kidneys become less efficient in removing waste from blood 
- bladder loses ability to store urine 
- brain cells also lose some functioning, but new neurons can also be produced

Many of these changes are determined by genetics, lifestyle, and disease.

### Changes to the Body

Everyone's body shape changes naturally as they age. After the age of 30, people tend to lose lean tissue as well as some cells of the muscles, liver, kidney, and other organs. Tissue loss reduces the amount of water in your body and bones may lose some of their minerals and become less dense. Moreover, the amount of body fat goes up steadily after the age of 30, and older individuals may have almost one third more fat compared to when they were younger. Fat tissue builds up toward the center of the body, including around the internal organs.

### Changes to the Skin

As adults age their skin becomes thinner, less elastic, loses fat, and no longer looks plump and smooth. Veins and bones can be seen easier, and scratches, cuts, and bumps can take longer to heal. Years exposed to the sun may lead to wrinkles, dryness, age spots, and cancer. Older people may bruise more easily, and it can take longer for these bruises to heal. Some medicines or illnesses may also cause bruising. Gravity can cause skin to sag and wrinkle, and smoking can wrinkle the skin. Also, commonly seen in older adults are age spots (liver spots) and skin tags. While age spots look like flat, brown spots and are often caused by years in the sun, skin tags are small, usually flesh-colored growths of skin that have a raised surface.

#### Changes to the Hair and Nails

Aging adults suffer from hair loss as the rate of hair growth slows down and hair follicles stop producing new hairs. The loss of pigment and subsequent graying continues in late adulthood. The body and face also lose hair. Moreover, facial hair may grow coarser. For women this often occurs around the chin and above the upper lip. For men the hair of the eyebrows, ears, and nose may grow longer. Nails, particularly toenails, may become hard and thick. Lengthwise ridges may also develop in the fingernails and toenails. It is necessary to get pits, lines, changes in shape or color checked by a healthcare provider as they can be related to nutritional deficiencies or kidney disease.

### Loss of Height due to Aging 

The tendency to become shorter as one ages occurs among all races and both sexes. Height loss is related to aging changes in the bones, muscles, and joints. People typically lose almost one-half inch every 10 years after age 40, and height loss is even more rapid after age 70. A total of 1 to 3 inches in height is lost with aging. 

#### Gain/Loss of Weight due to Aging 

Changes in body weight vary for men and women. Men often gain weight until about age 55, and then begin to lose weight later in life, possibly related to a drop in the male sex hormone testosterone. Women usually gain weight until age 65, and then begin to lose weight. Weight loss later in life occurs partly because fat replaces lean muscle tissue, and fat weighs less than muscle. Diet and exercise play an important role in weight changes in late adulthood. 

### Sarcopenia

Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle tissue as a natural part of aging. Sarcopenia is most noticeable in men, and physically inactive people. Symptoms include a loss of stamina and weakness, which can decrease physical activity and subsequently further shrink muscles. Sarcopenia typically happens faster around age 75, but it may also speed up as early as 65 or as late as 80. Factors involved in sarcopenia include a reduction in nerve cells responsible for sending signals to the muscles from the brain to begin moving, a decrease in the ability to turn protein into energy, and not receiving enough calories or protein to sustain adequate muscle mass. Maintaining strong leg and heart muscles are important for independence. Weightlifting, walking, swimming, or engaging in other cardiovascular exercises can help strengthen the muscles and prevent atrophy.

### Having a Healthy Diet

A healthy diet is necessary for older adults to increase mental acuteness, resistance to illness and disease, boost energy levels, improve immune system strength, recuperation speed, and have greater effectiveness in the management of chronic health problems. 

#### An Ideal Diet

The diet of an older adult should contain: 

- 50% — fruits and vegetables
- 25% — grains (mostly whole grains)
- 25% — protein-rich foods (nuts, beans, fish, lean meat, poultry) and fat-free and low-fat dairy products (milk, cheeses, and yogurts)

#### Challenges 

Unfortunately, changes in sensory functions, such as smell and taste, along with loss of teeth, can derail an older adult's ability to eat right. Older adults are likely to use salt and sugar to flavor foods that no longer taste the way they once did. Several government websites provide older adults with alternatives to make foods more palatable.

### Changes in Vision

By late adulthood, there are many evident changes to the vision of a person. Cataracts, macular degeneration, and glaucoma are the three serious eye diseases that are more common in older adults, of which only cataracts can be cured. 
[Opens in new tab](https://assets.wgu.edu/3aaa27b1bff676375a940055cc958987)"[Takes Her Knitting Seriously - stock photoOpens in new tab]("https://www.gettyimages.in/detail/photo/takes-her-knitting-seriously-royalty-free-image/1179988432?adppopup=true")" by SolStock, [Getty Images Content License AgreementOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.com/eula#RF)
#### Cataracts

Cataracts are a clouding of the lens of the eye, wherein the protein present in the eye starts to clump, which in turn reduces the clarity of the lens. Cataracts also cause a discoloration of the lens, tinting it more yellow and then brown, which can interfere with the ability to distinguish colors such as black, brown, dark blue, or dark purple. More people have problems with cataracts after age 60 (NIH, 2014b) and by age 75, 70% of adults will have problems with cataracts (Boyd, 2014). 

Risk factors besides age include certain health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity, behavioral factors such as smoking, other environmental factors such as prolonged exposure to ultraviolet sunlight, previous trauma to the eye, long-term use of steroid medication, and a family history of cataracts (NEI, 2016a; Boyd, 2014). Cataracts are treated by removing and replacing the lens of the eye with a synthetic lens. 

##### Age-Related Macular Degeneration

Age-related macular degeneration is the loss of clarity in the center field of vision, due to the deterioration of the macula, the center of the retina. It can greatly impair day-to-day functioning.

There are two types of macular degeneration:

- Dry: occurs when tiny pieces of a fatty protein called drusen form beneath the retina resulting in the thinning of the macular (Boyd, 2016)
- Wet: caused by an abnormal development of blood vessels beneath the retina, which may leak fluid or blood causing more rapid loss of vision compared to the dry type

Risk factors for macular degeneration include smoking (NIH, 2015a), race, high cholesterol, and a family history of macular degeneration (Boyd, 2016). Since there is no effective treatment, certain patients may benefit from a cocktail of certain antioxidant vitamins and minerals that can slow the progression of visual loss in some people with dry macular degeneration (Boyd, 2016; NIH, 2015a). For the wet type medications that slow the growth of abnormal blood vessels, surgery like laser treatment to destroy the abnormal blood vessels may be used. 

#### Glaucoma

Glaucoma is the loss of peripheral vision, frequently due to a buildup of fluid in the eye that damages the optic nerve. As a person ages and as glaucoma progresses, more and more of the peripheral visual field deteriorates toward the central field of vision. In advanced stages of glaucoma, a person can lose their sight. People over the age of 60 have a higher risk for glaucoma. Those with diabetes and with a family history of glaucoma also have a higher risk (Owsley et al., 2015). There is no cure for glaucoma, but its rate of progression can be slowed, especially with early diagnosis. 

### Loss of Hearing

As a person ages, their hearing declines both in terms of the frequencies of sound that can be detected, and the intensity of sound needed to hear. Two common types of hearing loss are:

- presbycusis: runs in the family, results in a gradual loss of hearing and affects hearing in both ears (NIA, 2015c).
- tinnitus: Older adults may notice a ringing, hissing, or roaring sound in the ears also known as tinnitus. The exact cause of tinnitus is unknown, although it can be related to hypertension and allergies. 

The incidence of both presbycusis and tinnitus increases with age and males have higher rates of both around the world (McCormak, Edmondson-Jones, Somerset, & Hall, 2016). Further, the auditory system helps a person to hear and maintain balance. With age, this function of the inner ear declines, which can lead to problems with balance when sitting, standing, or moving (Martin, 2014).

### Effects of Aging on Taste and Smell

Olfactory cells are in a small area high in the nasal cavity. These cells are stimulated by two pathways: when air is inhaled through the nose, or via the connection between the nose and the throat when food is chewed and digested. It is a problem with this second pathway that explains why some foods such as chocolate or coffee seem tasteless when a person has a cold.

After the age of 50, people start to lose some of the sensory cells and may notice evident changes in taste once they are 60 (NIH: Senior Health, 2016b). Even an adult's sense of smell, or olfaction, decreases with age. This loss of smell due to aging is called presbyosmia while total loss of smell is called anosmia.

#### Problems with Sense of Smell

Problems with the sense of smell are more common in men than in women (NIH: Senior Health, 2016b). These problems can be linked to other serious medical conditions such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, or multiple sclerosis (NIH: Senior Health, 2016a). Any sudden change should be checked out.

### Effects of Aging on Touch

Research has found that with age, people may experience reduced or changed sensations of vibration, cold, heat, pressure, or pain (Martin, 2014), which are aligned with several medical conditions that are more common among the elderly, such as diabetes. However, there are changes in touch sensations among healthy older adults. The ability to detect changes in pressure has been shown to decline with age, with it being more pronounced by the 6th decade and diminishing further with advanced age (Bowden & McNelty, 2013). However, some adults who show increasing insensitivity to pressure, temperature, or pain are at risk for injury (Martin, 2014). 

### Effects of Aging on Ability to Feel Pain

According to Molton and Terrill (2014), approximately 60%–75% of people over the age of 65 report at least some chronic pain, and this rate is even higher for those individuals living in nursing homes. Although the presence of pain increases with age, older adults are less sensitive to pain than younger adults as there were age-related decreases in brain volume in those structures involved in pain (Harkins, Price, & Martinelli, 1986). Especially noteworthy were changes in the prefrontal cortex, brainstem, and hippocampus. 

Women are more likely to identify feeling pain than men as they have fewer opioid receptors in the brain and receive less relief from opiate drugs (Tsang et al., 2008; Garrett, 2015). Because pain serves as an important indicator that there is something wrong, a decreased sensitivity to pain in older adults is a concern because it can conceal illnesses or injuries requiring medical attention. 

Chronic health problems, including arthritis, cancer, diabetes, joint pain, sciatica, and shingles are responsible for most of the pain felt by older adults (Molton & Terrill, 2014). Some older individuals worry about developing an addiction to pain medication, but if the medicine is taken exactly as prescribed, addiction should not be a concern (NIH, 2015b). Lastly, side effects from pain medicine including constipation, dry mouth, and drowsiness may occur that can adversely affect the elder’s life. 

#### Pain Management 

Managing pain is crucial to ensure feelings of well-being for the older adult. When chronic pain is not managed, the individual will restrict their movements for fear of feeling pain or injuring themselves further. This lack of activity will result in more restriction, further decreased participation, and greater disability (Jensen, Moore, Bockow, Ehde, & Engel, 2011). Learning to cope effectively with pain is an important consideration in late adulthood and working with one's primary physician or a pain specialist is recommended (NIH, 2015b).

### What Are Chronic Illnesses? 

Chronic illnesses are illnesses that are ongoing, generally incurable conditions that require continuing medical attention and affect daily life. As individuals live longer, diseases that affect older individuals will become more prevalent, and the burden of chronic illness grows with age.

#### Statistics 

Less than 50% of adults within the age group of 50–64 have a chronic condition while 90% aged 75 and up do have a chronic condition (Cohen, 2011). Almost 80% have at least one chronic disease, and 77% have at least two chronic diseases (National Council on Aging, 2019). Further, older women are more likely to have a chronic condition than older men (CDC, 2009).

The table below lists the percentage of older adults who have certain chronic illnesses based on the National Health Survey conducted in 2014.

### Risk of Cancer due to Aging

Advancing age is a significant risk factor for cancer, with persons over 65 accounting for 60% of newly diagnosed cancer and 70% of all cancer deaths (Berger et al., 2006). Additionally, more than 70% of the mortality associated with many cancers, including prostate, bladder, colon, uterus, pancreas, stomach, rectum, and lung occur in patients 65 and older. Other conditions affecting the elderly that occur with cancer include anemia, coronary artery diseases, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, renal insufficiency, cerebrovascular diseases, neurovascular complications of diabetes mellitus, and arthritis that restricts mobility (Balducci & Extermann, 2000). Comorbidity also complicates treatment.   

The table below identifies the percentages of deaths due to cancer and cardiovascular disease for selected age groups in 2016.

#### Table S3, L3.5 Death Percentages for Cancer and Heart Disease for Selected Age Groups
2016 Causes of Death45-6465+85+Cancer29.221.112.1Heart Disease20.925.325.3
####   
Treatment Concerns

Due to aging, there is a decline in multiple organ systems that can adversely affect the ability of medications to treat the cancer. Chemotherapy has been found to compromise the cognitive function of those being treated for cancer, and it may further exacerbate dementia and elderly cognitive declines. Frail individuals, defined as having limited life expectancy and near-to-exhausted functional reserves, are also not considered candidates for more toxic forms of chemotherapy. With cancer, the prevalence and risk of malnutrition are higher, and diminished visual and hearing function makes elderly cancer patients more susceptible to environmental injury.

#### Depression and Cancer

Screening for depression is also recommended because depression is associated with weight loss, failure to thrive, and may reduce the motivation to receive treatment. Consequently, depression has been associated with decreased survival rates in the elderly (Berger et al., 2006).

### Heart Disease and Aging 

There are changes to the heart that happen with age, and some may increase a person’s risk of heart disease. These include stiffening blood vessels and valves, which may result in leaks or problems pumping blood out of the heart (NIA, 2012). Heart disease (most commonly, atherosclerosis) is the leading cause of death for those in late adulthood (CDC, 2016b). However, atherosclerosis is not part of normal aging. 

Many of the problems older people have with their heart and blood vessels are caused by disease and not by aging. Therefore, leading a heart-healthy lifestyle is most important to keeping one's heart strong in late adulthood.

### Aging and Arthritis

Arthritis and other rheumatic conditions are the most common cause of disability, wherein, approximately 62% of adults with arthritis are 65 years and older (NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, 2014).

People suffering from arthritis have some degree of mobility limitations, such as climbing stairs, walking, and grasping objects. The pain and other limitations of arthritis can also increase the risk of depression and other forms of mental distress. 

#### Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. The common risk factors for osteoarthritis include genetics, obesity, age, previous injury, and other medical conditions.

### What Is Osteoporosis?

Osteoporosis is a disease that thins and weakens bones to the point that they become fragile and break easily. 

### Osteoporosis and Aging 

After age 50, 1 in 2 women and 1 in 4 men will experience an osteoporosis related fracture in their lifetime, often leading to hip, spine, and wrist fractures (Dailey & Cravedi, 2006). Moreover, broken hips greatly increase the risk of death, especially during the year after they break (NIH Senior Health, 2015). 

### Kyphosis

Kyphosis occurs when bones weaken in the spine, resulting in adults gradually losing height and having a hunched over posture. Over time a bent spine can make it hard to walk or even sit up.

### Prevention of Loss of Bone Mass

Adults can prevent the loss of bone mass by eating a healthy diet with enough calcium and vitamin D, regularly exercising, limiting alcohol, and not smoking (National Osteoporosis Foundation, 2016).

### What Is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease? 

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease in which the airways become damaged making it difficult to breathe. COPD includes problems such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis (NIH Senior Health, 2013). 
[Opens in new tab](https://assets.wgu.edu/88b40b86a1e6476d5c3d181ee559cc84)"[Daily Life of a Person with Chronic Illness - stock photoOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/daily-life-of-a-person-with-chronic-illness-royalty-free-image/898560282)" by Elena Eliachevitch, [Getty Images Content License AgreementOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.com/eula#RF)
#### Diagnosis and Treatment

As COPD develops slowly, people may not notice the early signs and may attribute the shortness of breath to age or lack of physical exercise. Most people are not diagnosed until midlife or late adulthood. There is no cure, so treatments aim at slowing further damage. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD, but other types of tobacco smoking, such as a pipe or cigar, can cause COPD, especially if the smoke is inhaled. 

#### AAT and COPD

Some people are at risk for COPD because of a recessive genetic condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (NIH, 2011). AAT is a protein made in the liver that protects organs, especially the lungs, from the effects of other harmful proteins. In those with the genetic defect, the AAT protein created is the wrong shape and cannot leave the liver. This can lead to a heightened risk for lung disease and even liver disease. While some people with ATT deficiency are not affected and live a normal life, COPD is more likely to occur in such individuals if their lungs are exposed to environmental irritants.

### What Are Shingles? 

According to the National Institute on Aging (2015e), shingles is a disease that affects your nerves and is caused by the same virus as chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). After you recover from chickenpox, the virus continues to live in some of your nerve cells. It is usually inactive, and most adults live with VZV in their body and never get shingles. However, the virus will become active in one in three adults and instead of causing chickenpox again, it produces shingles. 

#### Risk Factors for Shingles

A risk factor for shingles includes advanced age, as people have a harder time fighting off infections as they get older. About half of all shingles cases are in adults aged 60 or older, while the chance of getting shingles by age 70 is higher. Other factors that weaken an individual's ability to fight infections, such as cancer, HIV infections, or other medical conditions, can put one at a greater risk for developing shingles.

#### Effects of Shingles

Shingles result in pain, burning, tingling, or itching in the affected area, as well as a rash and blisters. Typically, shingles develop only on one side of the body or face and in a small area rather than all over. After the shingles rash goes away, some people may be left with ongoing pain, called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in the area where the rash had been (NIA, 2015e).

Some people with PHN find it hard to go about their daily activities, like dressing, cooking, and eating. They can also suffer from depression, anxiety, and sleeplessness. Medicines can help with pain and usually PHN will disappear. Unfortunately, the blisters from shingles may become infected or leave a scar. Blisters near or in the eye can cause lasting eye damage or blindness. A brief paralysis of the face, hearing loss, and very rarely, swelling of the brain (encephalitis) can also occur.

### Positive Health Beliefs

Even though the majority of older adults have at least one chronic illness, most rate their overall health positively (Graham, 2019). This is because older adults focus more on emotional well-being, positive social relationships, remaining active, and overall life satisfaction. Poor physical functioning is not considered as important. 

Older adults often look to those who are worse off than themselves, including those having died or are in a nursing home, and consequently feel more positive about themselves. Older adults expect there will be some deterioration in their health and are able to adapt to it. Similarly, most older adults identify positive mental health in conjunction with their physical health.

### Lesson 4: Introduction

Early adulthood is a period of major life transitions after adolescence and before middle age. In this lesson you will learn about cognitive growth during early adulthood, peaking around the age of 35.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain the typical cognitive development during early adulthood.

### Beyond Formal Operational Thought

According to Piaget's theory, it is in adolescence that people acquire formal operational thought. The hallmark of this type of thinking is the ability to think abstractly, meaning to consider possibilities and ideas about circumstances never directly experienced.

Thinking abstractly is only one characteristic of adult thought, however. If you compare a 15-year-old with a 38-year-old, you would probably find that the latter considers not only what is possible, but also what is likely. Why the change?

Adults have gained experience and understand why possibilities do not always become a reality. They learn to base decisions on what is realistic and practical, not idealistic, and they can make adaptive choices. Adults are also not as influenced by what others think as adolescents. This advanced type of thinking is referred to as** postformal thought** (Sinnott, 1998).

### Dialectical Thought

In addition to moving toward more practical considerations, thinking in early adulthood may also become more flexible and balanced. Abstract ideas that the adolescent believes in firmly may become standards by which the adult evaluates reality. Adolescents tend to think in** dichotomies**—ideas are true or false; good or bad—and there is no middle ground. However, with experience, the adult comes to recognize that there is some right and some wrong in each position, some good or some bad in a policy or approach, some truth and some falsity in a particular idea. 

This ability to bring together important aspects of two opposing viewpoints or positions is referred to as **dialectical thought** and is considered one of the most advanced aspects of postformal thinking (Basseches, 1984). Such thinking is more realistic because very few positions, ideas, situations, or people are completely right or wrong. So, for example, parents who were considered wonderful or terrible by the adolescent eventually become, to the emerging adult, just people with strengths and weaknesses, endearing qualities, and faults.

### More on Formal Operational Thought

**Formal operational thought** involves being able to think abstractly; however, this ability does not apply to all situations or adults. Formal operational thought is influenced by experience and education. Some adults lead lives in which they are not challenged to think abstractly about their world. Many adults do not receive any formal education and are not taught to think abstractly about situations they have never experienced. Further, they are also not exposed to conceptual tools used to formally analyze hypothetical situations.

Those who do think abstractly may be able to do so more easily in some subjects than others. For example, psychology majors may be able to think abstractly about psychology, but they may be unable to use abstract reasoning in physics or chemistry. Abstract reasoning in a particular field requires a knowledge base people might not have in all areas. Consequently, the ability to think abstractly often depends on experience.

### Education in Adulthood

According to the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS) (2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2016d), in the United States:

- 84 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds and 88 percent of those 25 and older have a high school diploma or its equivalent
- 36 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds and 7 percent of 25- to 49-year-olds attend college
- 59 percent of those 25 and older have completed some college
- 32.5 percent of those 25 and older have a bachelor's degree or higher, with slightly more women (33 percent) than men (32 percent) holding a college degree (Ryan & Bauman, 2016)

The rate of college degree attainment has grown more slowly in the United States than in a number of other nations in recent years (OCED, 2014). This may be due to the fact that the cost of attaining a degree is higher in the United States than in many other nations.

In 2017, 65 percent of graduates from private and public nonprofit colleges had student loan debt, and nationally, they owed an average of $28,650, a 1 percent decline from 2016 (The Institute for College Access & Success [TICAS], 2018). This graph shows average U.S. college graduate debt from 1996 through 2017:

In 2017, 65% of college seniors who graduated from private and public non-profit colleges had student loan debt, and nationally owed an average of $28,650, a 1% decline from 2016, according to The Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS), 2018.Lally, M., and Valentine-French, S. (2019). [Lifespan development: A psychological perspective, 2nd ed.Opens in new tab](http://dept.clcillinois.edu/psy/LifespanDevelopment.pdf) / modified from original by WGU
According to the most recent TICAS annual report, the rate of debt varied widely across states, as well as among colleges. The after-graduation debt ranged from $18,850 in Utah to $38,500 in Connecticut. Low-debt states are mainly in the West, and high-debt states in the Northeast.   
  
In recent years, there has been a concern about students carrying more debt and being more likely to default when attending for-profit institutions. In 2016, students at for-profit schools borrowed an average of $39,900, 41 percent higher than students at non-profit schools that year. In addition, 30 percent of students attending for-profit colleges default on their federal student loans. In contrast, the default level of those who attended public institutions is only 4 percent (TICAS, 2018).

### College Debt

College student debt has become a key issue at both the state and federal political level, and some states have been taking steps to increase spending and grants to help students with the cost of college. However, 15 percent of the graduating class of 2017 owed their college debt to private lenders (TICAS, 2018). Such debt has less consumer protection, fewer options for repayment, and is typically negotiated at a higher interest rate. This table shows debt comparisons for six U.S. states.

### Graduate School

Larger amounts of student debt actually occur at the graduate level (Kreighbaum, 2019). In 2019, the highest average debts were concentrated in the medical fields. Median debt for graduate programs:

- $42,335 for a master’s degree
- $95,715 for a doctoral degree
- $141,000 for a professional degree

Worldwide, over 80 percent of college educated adults are employed, compared with just over 70 percent of those with a high school or equivalent diploma, and only 60 percent of those with no high school diploma (OECD, 2015). Those with a college degree will earn more over the course of their lifetime.

College is a substantial investment each year, with the financial burden falling on students and their families in the U.S., and mainly by the government in many other nations. Nonetheless, the benefits both to the individual and the society outweighs the initial costs. As can be seen in this set of bar graphs, those in America with the most advanced degrees earn the highest income and have the lowest unemployment.Lally, M., and Valentine-French, S. (2019).

Moreover, the benefits of college education go beyond employment and finances. The OECD found that around the world, adults with higher educational attainment were more likely to volunteer, felt they had more control over their lives, and were more interested in the world around them. Studies of U.S. college students find that they gain a more distinct identity and become more socially competent, less dogmatic, and less ethnocentric compared to those not in college (Pascarella, 2006).

### Career Development 

Work plays a significant role in the lives of people, and emerging and early adulthood is the time when most people make choices that will establish their careers. Career development has a number of stages:

- Stage One: Children may select careers based on what appears glamorous or exciting to them (Patton & McMahon, 1999). There is little regard at this stage for whether they are suited for their occupational choices.
- Stage Two: Teens include consideration of their abilities and limitations, in addition to the glamour of various occupations, when narrowing their choices.
- Stage Three: Older teens and emerging adults narrow their choices further and begin to weigh more objectively the requirements, rewards, and downsides to careers, along with comparing possible careers with their own interests, values, and future goals (Patton & McMahon, 1999). However, some young people in this stage "fall-into" careers simply because these were what were available at the time, because of family pressures to pursue particular paths, or because these were high paying jobs, rather than from an intrinsic interest in that career path (Patton & McMahon, 1999).
- Stage Four: Super (1980) suggests that by mid- to late-thirties, many adults settle in their careers. Even though they might change companies or move up in position, there is a sense of continuity and forward motion in their careers. However, some people at this point in their working life may feel trapped, especially if there is little opportunity for advancement in a dead-end job.

#### Millennials: Young Adults

How have things changed for **millennials** (people born in the 1980s and 1990s)****compared with previous generations of early adults? In recent years, young adults are more likely to find themselves job-hopping and periodically returning to school for further education and retraining than in prior generations. However, researchers find that occupational interests remain fairly stable.   
  
Thus, despite the more frequent change in jobs, most people are generally seeking jobs with similar interests rather than entirely new careers (Rottinghaus et al., 2007). As of 2016, millennials became the largest generation in the labor force of employment (Fry, 2018).

Baby Boomers were 66 million in 1994, down to 41 million in 2016. Gen Xers were about 38 million in 1994, up to 53 million in 2016. Millennials were 0 in 1994 and 56 million in 2016. Post-Millennials were at 0 participation from 1994 through 2012 and 9 million in 2016.Lally, M., and Valentine-French, S. (2019). [Lifespan development: A psychological perspective, 2nd ed.Opens in new tab](http://dept.clcillinois.edu/psy/LifespanDevelopment.pdf) / modified from original by WGU
Recent research also suggests that millennials are looking for something different in their place of employment. According to a recent Gallup Poll report (2016), millennials want more than a paycheck; they want a purpose.   
  
Unfortunately, only 29 percent of millennials surveyed by Gallup reported that they were "engaged" at work. In fact, they report being less engaged than **gen-Xers** and **baby boomers**; with 55 percent of millennials saying they are not engaged at all with their jobs. This indifference to their workplaces may explain the greater tendency to switch jobs.   
  
With their current jobs giving them little reason to stay, they are more likely to take new opportunities and move on. Only half of millennials saw themselves working at the same company a year later. Gallup estimates that this lack of engagement and resulting employment turnover cost businesses $30.5 billion a year.

### Lesson 5: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how the brains of middle-aged individuals demonstrate better cognitive performance than those of young people, leading to satisfaction in work at midlife and a productive climate in workplaces. However, there are also some challenges faced by middle-aged adults in the workplace.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain typical cognitive development during middle adulthood.

### Brain Functioning 

The brain at midlife has been shown to not only maintain many of the abilities of young adults, but also to gain new ones. Some individuals in middle age actually have improved cognitive functioning (Phillips, 2011). The brain continues to demonstrate plasticity and rewires itself in middle age based on experiences.   
  
Research has demonstrated that older adults use more of their brains than younger adults. In fact, older adults who perform the best on tasks are more likely to demonstrate **bi-lateralization** (simultaneous use of both sides of the brain) than those who perform worst. Additionally, the amount of white matter in the brain, which is responsible for forming connections among neurons, increases into a person's fifties before it declines. 

Emotionally, the middle-aged brain is calmer, less neurotic, more capable of managing emotions, and better able to negotiate social situations (Phillips, 2011). Older adults tend to focus more on positive information and less on negative information than those who are younger. In fact, they also remember positive images better than those who are younger.   
  
Additionally, the older adult responds less to negative stimuli. Lastly, adults in middle adulthood make better financial decisions, which seems to peak at age 53, and show better economic understanding. Although greater cognitive variability occurs among middle adults when compared with those both younger and older, those in midlife with cognitive improvements tend to be more physically, cognitively, and socially active.

### Crystalized versus Fluid Intelligence 

Intelligence is influenced by heredity, culture, social contexts, personal choices, and, certainly, age. One distinction in specific intelligences is between **fluid intelligence,** which refers to the capacity to learn new ways of solving problems and performing activities quickly and abstractly, and **crystallized intelligence**, which refers to the accumulated knowledge of the world that is acquired throughout one's life (Salthouse, 2004). These intelligences are distinct, and crystallized intelligence increases with age, while fluid intelligence tends to decrease with age (Horn, Donaldson, & Engstrom, 1981; Salthouse, 2004).

Research demonstrates that older adults have more crystallized intelligence as reflected in semantic knowledge, vocabulary, and language. As a result, adults generally outperform younger people on measures of history, geography, and even on crossword puzzles, where this information is useful (Salthouse, 2004). It is this superior knowledge, combined with a slower and more complete processing style and a more sophisticated understanding of the workings of the world, that gives older adults the advantage of "wisdom" over the advantages of fluid intelligence (Baltes, Staudinger, & Lindenberger, 1999; Scheibe, Kunzmann, & Baltes, 2009).

The differential changes in crystallized versus fluid intelligence help explain why older adults do not necessarily show poorer performance on tasks that also require experience (crystallized intelligence), although they show poorer memory overall. A young chess player may think more quickly, for instance, but a more experienced chess player has more knowledge to draw on.

This graph shows fluid and crystalized intelligence across the life span.

### The Novice and the Expert

**Expertise** refers to specialized skills and knowledge that pertain to a particular topic or activity. In contrast, a **novice** is someone who has limited experiences with a particular task. Everyone develops some level of "selective" expertise in things that are personally meaningful to them, such as making bread, quilting, computer programming, or diagnosing illness. Expert thought is often characterized as intuitive, automatic, strategic, and flexible. These are some important characteristics of expertise:

- **Intuitive:** Novices follow particular steps and rules when problem solving, whereas experts can call upon a vast amount of knowledge and past experience. As a result, their actions appear more intuitive than formulaic. Novice cooks may slavishly follow the recipe step by step, while chefs may glance at recipes for ideas and then follow their own procedure. 
- **Automatic:** Complex thoughts and actions become more routine for experts. Their reactions appear instinctive over time, and this is because expertise allows them to process information faster and more effectively (Crawford & Channon, 2002). 
- **Strategic:** Experts have more effective strategies than novices. For instance, while both skilled and novice doctors generate several hypotheses within minutes of an encounter with a patient, the more skilled clinicians' conclusions are likely to be more accurate. In other words, they generate better hypotheses than the novice. This is because they are able to discount misleading symptoms and other distractions and home in on the most likely problem the patient is experiencing (Norman, 2005).   
  
Consider how your note-taking skills may have changed after being in school over a number of years. Chances are you do not write down everything the instructor says, only the central ideas. You may have even come up with your own short forms for commonly mentioned words in a course, allowing you to take down notes faster and more efficiently than someone who may be a novice academic note-taker.
- **Flexible:** Experts in all fields are more curious and creative; they enjoy a challenge and experiment with new ideas or procedures. The only way for experts to grow in their knowledge is to take on more challenging rather than routine tasks.

#### Expert vs. Novice

Expertise takes time. It is a long process building on experience and practice (Ericsson et al., 2006). Middle-aged adults, with their store of knowledge and experience, are likely to find that when faced with a problem, they have faced something similar before. This allows them to ignore the irrelevant and focus on the important aspects of the issue. Expertise is one reason many people often reach the top of their careers in middle adulthood.

However, expertise cannot fully make up for all losses in general cognitive functioning as people age. The superior performance of older adults in comparison to younger novices appears to be task-specific (Charness & Krampe, 2006). As adults age, they also need to be more deliberate in their practice of skills in order to maintain them. Charness and Krampe (2006), in their review of the literature on aging and expertise, also note that the rate of return for effort diminishes with age. In other words, increasing practice does not recoup the same advances in older adults as similar efforts do at younger ages.

### U.S. Workforce

The civilian, non-institutionalized workforce (the population of those aged 16 and older) who are employed has steadily declined since it reached its peak in the late 1990s, when 67 percent of the civilian workforce population was employed. In 2012, the rate had dropped to 64 percent, and by 2019, it had declined to 62.9 percent (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019).   
  
The U.S. population is expected to grow more slowly based on census projections for the next few years. Those new entrants to the labor force, adults aged 16 to 24, are the only population of adults that will shrink in size over the next few years by nearly half a percent, while those aged 55 and up will grow by 2.3 percent over current rates, and those aged 65 to 74 will grow by nearly 4 percent (Monthly Labor Review [MLR], 2013). In 1992, 26 percent of the population was 55 and older; by 2022, this age group is projected to be 38 percent of the total population.

This table shows the rates of employment by age.

#### Table S3, L5.3 Percentage of the non-institutionalized civilian workforce employed by gender and age.

*Projected rates of employment (adapted from Monthly Labor Review, 2013).  
  
In 2002, baby boomers were between the ages of 38 and 56, the prime employment group. In 2012, the youngest baby boomers were 48 and the oldest had just retired (aged 66). These changes might explain some of the steady decline in work participation as this large population cohort ages out of the workforce.  
  
In 2012, 53 percent of the workforce was male. For both genders and for most age groups, the rate of participation in the labor force has declined from 2002 to 2012, and it is projected to decline further by 2022. The exception is among the older middle-age groups (the baby boomers), and especially for women aged 55 and older.   
  
Hispanic males have the highest rate of participation in the labor force. In 2012, 76 percent of Hispanic males, compared with 71 percent of White, 72 percent of Asian, and 64 percent of Black men aged 16 or older were employed. Among women, Black women were more likely to be participating in the workforce (58 percent) compared with almost 57 percent of Hispanic and Asian, and 55 percent of White females. The rates for all racial and ethnic groups are expected to decline by 2022 (MLR, 2013).  
  

### Climate in the Workplace for Middle-Aged Adults

A number of studies have found that job satisfaction tends to peak in middle adulthood (Besen et al., 2013; Easterlin, 2006). This satisfaction stems from not only higher wages, but often greater involvement in decisions that affect the workplace as people move from worker to supervisor or manager. Job satisfaction is also influenced by being able to do the job well, and after years of experience at a job many people are more effective and productive.
[Opens in new tab](https://assets.wgu.edu/f232432c605ddb50ce7f2a5ed5c89d6b)"[Senior woman with laptop explaining and gesturing with colleagues - stock photoOpens in new tab]("https://www.gettyimages.in/detail/photo/senior-woman-with-laptop-explaining-and-gesturing-royalty-free-image/1084168320?adppopup=true")" by 10'000 Hours, [Getty Images Content License AgreementOpens in new tab](https://www.gettyimages.com/eula#RF)
Another reason for this peak in job satisfaction is that, at midlife, many adults lower their expectations and goals (Tangri et al., 2003). Middle-aged employees may realize they have reached the highest they are likely to in their career. This satisfaction at work translates into lower absenteeism, greater productivity, and less job hopping in comparison with younger adults (Easterlin, 2006). 

However, not all middle-aged adults are happy in the workplace. Women may find themselves up against the "glass ceiling" (a metaphorical description of an invisible barrier to upper management). This may explain why females employed at large corporations are twice as likely to quit their jobs as are men (Barreto et al., 2009).

### Burnout

Another problem older workers may encounter is job **burnout,** defined as unsuccessfully managed workplace stress (World Health Organization, 2019). Burnout consists of:

- Feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion 
- Increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativity toward the job 
- Reduced professional effectiveness

American workers may experience more burnout than do workers in many other developed nations because other developed nations guarantee by law a set number of paid vacation days (International Labour Organization [ILO], 2011); the United States does not (U.S. Department of Labor, 2016).

Not all employees are covered under overtime pay laws (U.S. Department of Labor, 2016). This is important when you consider that the 40-hour work week is a myth for most Americans. Only four in ten U.S. workers work the typical 40-hour work week. The average work week for many is almost a full day longer (47 hours), with 39 percent working 50 or more hours per week (Saad, 2014).   
  
In comparison with workers in many other developed nations, American workers work more hours per year (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD], 2016). As can be seen in the image, Americans work more hours than most European nations, especially western and northern Europe, although they work fewer hours than workers in some nations, especially Mexico.

This graph shows the average annual hours actually worked per worker in different countries.

### Challenges in the Workplace for Middle-Aged Adults

In recent years, middle-aged adults have been challenged by economic downturns, one in 2001 and another in 2008. Fifty-five percent of adults reported some problems in the workplace such as fewer hours, pay-cuts, or having to switch to part-time during the 2007-08 economic recession (Pew Research Center, 2010a). While young adults took the biggest hit in terms of levels of unemployment, middle-aged adults also saw their overall financial resources suffer as their retirement nest eggs disappeared and house values shrank, while foreclosures increased (Pew Research Center, 2010b).   
  
Not surprisingly, this age group reported that the recession hit them worse than did other age groups, especially those aged 50 to 64. Middle-aged adults who find themselves unemployed are likely to remain unemployed longer than those in early adulthood (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2012). In the eyes of employers, it may be more cost-effective to hire a young adult, despite limited experience, who would be starting out at lower pay.   
  
In addition, hiring someone who is 25 and has many years of work ahead versus someone who is 55 and will likely retire in 10 years may also be part of the decision (Lachman, 2004). American workers are also competing with global markets and changes in technology. Those who are able to keep up with all these changes or are willing to uproot and move around the country—or even around the world—have a better chance of finding work. The decision to move may be easier for people who are younger and have fewer obligations to others.

This graph shows the percentage of each group who experienced challenges since the recession of 2008 began.

### Key Term

- **burnout:** unsuccessfully managed workplace stress

### Lesson 6: Introduction

The study of cognitive development in late adulthood is quite complex. Neural and motor speeds decrease with age so older people can find themselves struggling to perform day-to-day activities. In this lesson, you will learn about typical cognitive development from late adulthood to the end of life. 

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain typical cognitive development from late adulthood to the end of life.

### Brain Functioning

Research has demonstrated that the brain loses 5 to 10 percent of its weight between 20 and 90 years of age (Fjell & Walhovd, 2010). This decrease in brain volume appears to be due to the shrinkage of neurons, lower number of synapses, and shorter length of axons. According to Garrett (2015), the normal decline in cognitive ability throughout the life span has been associated with brain changes, including the reduced activity of genes involved in memory storage, **synaptic pruning**, plasticity, and **glutamate** (an amino acid that acts as a neurotransmitter and plays a vital role in learning, memory, and brain development) and **GABA**** receptors** (GABA stands for gamma-aminobutyric acid; it is an amino acid involved in stress responses).   
  
There is also a loss in white matter connections between brain areas. Without myelin, neurons demonstrate slower conduction and impede each other’s actions. A loss of synapses occurs in specific brain areas, including the hippocampus (involved in memory) and the forebrain region. Older individuals also activate larger regions of their attention and executive networks (located in the parietal and prefrontal cortex) when they perform complex tasks. This increased activation correlates with reduced performance on both executive tasks and tests of working memory when compared to those younger (Kolb & Whishaw, 2011).

### Continued Neurogenesis

Researchers at the University of Chicago found that new neurons continued to form into old age. Tobin et al. (2019) examined the post-mortem brain tissue of individuals between the ages of 79 and 99 (an average age of 90.6) and found evidence of **neurogenesis** (creation of new neurons) in the hippocampus. Approximately 2,000 neural precursor cells and 150,000 developing neurons were found per brain, although the number of developing neurons was lower in people with cognitive impairments or Alzheimer’s disease. Tobin et al. hypothesized that the lower levels of neurogenesis in the hippocampus were associated with symptoms of cognitive decline and reduced synaptic plasticity (that is, changes in the connections between neurons that allow them to pass signals).

The brain in late adulthood also exhibits considerable plasticity and through practice and training, the brain can compensate for any age-related changes (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). Park and Reuter-Lorenz (2009) proposed the** scaffolding theory of aging and cognition**, which states that the brain adapts to the death of brain cells by building alternative connections, referred to as scaffolding, allowing older brains to retain high levels of performance.

**Brain compensation** is especially noted in the additional effort demonstrated by those individuals who are aging well. For example, older adults who performed just as well as younger adults on a memory task used both **prefrontal areas**, while only the **right prefrontal cortex** was used by younger participants (Cabeza et al., 2002). This decrease in **brain lateralization** (using only one side) appears to assist older adults with cognitive skills.  

### Healthy Brain Functioning

Cheng (2016) found that physical activity and stimulating cognitive activity resulted in significant reductions in the risk of neurocognitive disorders. Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, is associated with less age-related gray and white matter loss, as well as diminished **neurotoxins** (substances that could be considered "poisons" that interfere with the brain's functioning). Overall, physical activity preserves the integrity of neurons and brain volume. 

Cognitive training improves the efficiency of the prefrontal cortex and executive functions such as working memory and strengthens the plasticity of neural circuits. Both activities support **cognitive reserve,** "the structural and dynamic capacities of the brain that buffer against atrophies and lesions" (Cheng, 2016, p. 85). Although it is best to begin physical and cognitive activities early in life, it is not too late to start these programs in late adulthood to improve one’s cognitive health. 

#### Improving Brain Functioning

Many training programs have been created to improve brain functioning. ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly), a study conducted between 1999 and 2001 with 2,802 individuals aged 65 to 94, suggests that brain function can be improved. These racially diverse participants received 10 group training sessions and four follow-up sessions to work on tasks of memory, reasoning, and speed of processing.

These mental workouts improved cognitive functioning even five years later. Many of the participants believed that this improvement could be seen in everyday tasks as well (Tennstedt et al., 2006). However, programs for the elderly on memory, reading, and processing speed training demonstrate that there is improvement on the specific tasks trained but no generalization to other abilities (Jarrett, 2015).

These kinds of programs have not been shown to delay or slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, however. Although these programs are not harmful, "physical exercise, learning new skills, and socializing remain the most effective ways to train your brain" (Jarrett, 2015, p. 207). These activities appear to build a reserve to minimize the effects of the basic aging of the brain.

### Parkinson’s Disease

**Parkinson's disease** is characterized by motor tremors, loss of balance, poor coordination, rigidity, and difficulty moving (Garrett, 2015). Parkinson's affects approximately 1 percent of those over the age of 60, and it appears more frequently in family members in a little less than 10 percent of cases.   
  
Twenty-eight chromosomal areas have been implicated in Parkinson’s disease, but environmental factors have also been identified and include brain injury. Being knocked unconscious once increases the risk by 32 percent and being knocked out several times increases the risk by 174 percent (Garrett, 2015). Other environmental influences include toxins, industrial chemicals, carbon monoxide, herbicides, and pesticides (Olanow & Tatton, 1999).   
  
The symptoms are due to the deterioration of an area in the midbrain whose neurons send dopamine-releasing axons to the basal ganglia, which affects motor activity. Treatment typically includes the medication levodopa (L-dopa), which crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted into dopamine in the brain. Deep brain stimulation, which involves inserting an electrode into the brain that provides electrical stimulation, has resulted in improved motor functioning (Garrett, 2015).

### Sleep and Sleeping Disorders

Similar to other adults, older adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep per night, but they tend to go to sleep earlier and get up earlier than those younger. This pattern is called **advanced sleep phase syndrome** and is based on changes in circadian rhythms (National Sleep Foundation, 2009).   
  
There are sleep problems in older adults, and** insomnia** is the most common problem in those 60 and older (NIA, 2016). People with insomnia have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. There are many reasons why older people may have insomnia, including certain medications, being in pain, having a medical or psychiatric condition, and even worrying before bedtime about not being able to sleep. Using over-the-counter sleep aids or medication may only work when used for a short time. Consequently, sleep problems should be discussed with a healthcare professional.

#### Sleeping Disorders

Sleeping disorders are common in older adults, including these (NIA, 2016):

**Sleep apnea** refers to repeated short pauses in breathing, while an individual sleeps, which can lead to reduced oxygen in the blood. Snoring is a common symptom of sleep apnea and it often worsens with age. Untreated sleep apnea can lead to impaired daytime functioning, high blood pressure, headaches, stroke, and memory loss.

**Restless legs syndrome** feels like there is tingling, crawling, or pins and needles in one or both legs, and this feeling is worse at night.  
  
**Periodic limb movement disorder** causes people to jerk and kick their legs every 20 to 40 seconds during sleep.  
  
**Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder** occurs when one's muscles can move during REM sleep and sleep is disrupted. According to the National Sleep Foundation (2009), there are many medical conditions that affect sleep including gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, respiratory diseases such as asthma, and immune disorders.  
  
Diseases such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis also commonly cause problems sleeping. Lastly, Alzheimer's disease can interfere with sleeping patterns. Individuals may wake up many times during the night, wander when up, and yell, all of which can alter the amount of time they sleep.

Both minor and major sleep problems in older adults can lead to increased risk of accidents, falls, chronic fatigue, decreased quality of life, cognitive decline, reduced immune function, and depression (Buman, 2013).

Because of sleep problems experienced by those in late adulthood, research has looked into whether exercise can improve their quality of sleep. Results show that 150 minutes per week of exercise can improve sleep quality (Buman, 2013). This amount of exercise is also recommended to improve other health areas including lowering the risk for heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.   
  
Aerobic activity, weight training, and balance programs are all recommended. For those who live in assisted living facilities, even light exercise, such as stretching and short walks, can improve sleep. High-intensity activity is not necessary to see improvements. Overall, the effects of exercise on sleep may actually be even larger for older adults since their sleep quality may not be ideal to begin with.

### Sexuality

According to Kane (2008), older men and women are often viewed as genderless and asexual. There is a stereotype that elderly individuals no longer engage in sexual activity and when they do, they are perceived to have committed some kind of offense. These ageist myths can become internalized, and older people have a more difficult time accepting their sexuality (Gosney, 2011). Additionally, some older women indicate that they no longer worry about sexual concerns once they are past their childbearing years. 

In reality, many older couples find greater satisfaction in their sex life than they did when they were younger. They have fewer distractions, more time and privacy, no worries about getting pregnant, and greater intimacy with a lifelong partner (NIA, 2013). Results from the National Social Life Health, and Aging Project indicated that 72 percent of men and 45.5 percent of women aged 52 to 72 reported being sexually active (Karraker et al., 2011). Additionally, the National Survey of Sexual Health data indicated that 20 to 30 percent of individuals remain sexually active well into their eighties (Schick et al., 2010). However, there are issues that occur in older adults that can adversely affect their enjoyment of healthy sexual relationships.  

#### Causes of Sexual Problems

According to the National Institute on Aging (NIA) (2013), chronic illnesses including arthritis (joint pain), diabetes (erectile dysfunction), heart disease (difficulty achieving orgasm for both sexes), stroke (paralysis), and dementia (inappropriate sexual behavior) can all adversely affect sexual functioning. Hormonal changes, physical disabilities, surgeries, and medicines can also affect a senior’s ability to participate in and enjoy sex.  
  
How one feels about sex can also affect performance. For example, a woman who is unhappy about her appearance as she ages may think her partner will no longer find her attractive. Focus on youthful physical beauty for women may get in the way of their enjoyment of sex. Likewise, most men have a problem with erectile dysfunction (ED) once in a while, and some may fear that ED will become a more common problem as they age. If there is a decline in sexual activity for a heterosexual couple, it is typically due to a decline in the male’s physical health (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). 

Overall, the best way to experience a healthy sex life in later life is to keep sexually active while aging. However, the lack of an available partner can affect heterosexual women’s participation in a sexual relationship. Beginning at age 40, there are more women than men in the population, and the ratio becomes two to one at age 85 (Karraker et al., 2011). Because older men tend to pair with younger women when they become widowed or divorced, this also decreases the pool of available men for older women (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). In fact, a change in marital status does not result in a decline in the sexual behavior of men aged 57 to 85 years old, but it does result in a decline for similar-aged women (Karraker et al., 2011).

Key players in improving the quality of life among older adults will be those adults themselves. By exercising, reducing stress, stopping smoking, limiting use of alcohol, and consuming more fruits and vegetables, older adults can expect to live longer and more active lives (He et al., 2005). Stress reduction, both in late adulthood and earlier in life, is also crucial. The reduction of societal stressors can promote active life expectancy. In the last 40 years, smoking rates have decreased, but obesity has increased, and physical activity has only modestly increased.

### The Effects of Aging in Information Processing

There are numerous stereotypes regarding older adults as being forgetful and confused, but what does the research on memory and cognition in late adulthood reveal? Memory comes in many types and involves many processes, so it should not be a surprise that there are declines in some types of memory and memory processes, while other areas of memory are maintained or even show some improvement with age.   
  
Changes in memory, attention, problem-solving, intelligence, and wisdom—including the exaggeration of losses—are common stereotypes of the elderly. But are they valid?

### Memory

**Changes in Working Memory**

**Working memory** is the more active, effortful part of our memory system. Working memory is composed of three major systems: The** phonological loop** that maintains information about auditory stimuli, the **visuospatial sketchpad** that maintains information about visual stimuli, and the **central executive** that oversees working memory, allocating resources where needed and monitoring whether cognitive strategies are being effective (Schwartz, 2011). Schwartz (2011) reports that it is the central executive that is most negatively impacted by age. 

#### Changes in Long-Term Memory

As you should recall, long-term memory is divided into **episodic** (events), **semantic** (knowledge of facts), and **implicit** (procedural skills, classical conditioning, and priming) **memories**. Episodic and semantic memory is part of the **explicit memory system**, which requires conscious effort to create and retrieve. 

Several studies consistently reveal that episodic memory shows greater age-related declines than semantic memory (Schwartz, 2011; Spaniol, Madden, & Voss, 2006). It has been suggested that episodic memories may be harder to encode and retrieve because they contain at least two different types of memory, the event and when and where the event took place. 

In contrast, semantic memories are not tied to any particular timeline. Thus, only the knowledge needs to be encoded or retrieved (Schwartz, 2011). Spaniol et al. (2006) found that retrieval of semantic information was considerably faster for both younger and older adults than the retrieval of episodic information, with there being little difference between the two age groups for semantic memory retrieval. They note that older adults’ poorer performance on episodic memory appeared to be related to slower processing of the information and the difficulty of the task. They found that as the task became increasingly difficult, the gap between each age groups’ performance increased for episodic memory, more than for semantic memory.

Studies that test general knowledge (semantic memory) such as politics and history (Dixon, Rust, Feltmate, & See, 2007) or vocabulary (Dahlgren, 1998) often find that older adults outperformed younger adults. However, older adults do find that they experience more “blocks'' at retrieving information that they know. In other words, they experience more **tip-of-the-tongue** (TOT) events (in which a word feels that it is "on the tip of the tongue" but cannot be called up) than younger adults (Schwartz, 2011). 

#### Implicit Memory

**Implicit memory** requires little conscious effort and often involves skills or more habitual patterns of behavior. This type of memory shows few declines with age. Many studies assessing implicit memory measure the effects of priming. **Priming** refers to changes in behavior as a result of frequent or recent experiences.

If you were shown pictures of food and asked to rate their appearance and then later were asked to complete words such as s_ _ p, you may be more likely to write *soup* than *soap* or *ship*. The images of food "primed" your memory for words connected to food. Does this type of memory and learning change with age? The answer is typically "no" for most older adults (Schacter, Church, & Osowiecki, 1994). 

#### Prospective Memory

**Prospective memory** refers to remembering things that need to be done in the future, such as remembering a doctor’s appointment next week or taking medication before bedtime. It has been described as "the flip-side of episodic memory" (Schwartz, 2011, p. 119). Episodic memories are the recall of events in the past, while the focus of prospective memories is of events in the future.

However, prospective memories are often divided into **time-based prospective** memories, such as having to remember to do something at a future time, or **event-based prospective memories**, such as having to remember to do something when a certain event occurs. When age-related declines are found, they are more likely to be time-based than event-based and in laboratory settings rather than in the real-world, where older adults can show comparable or slightly better prospective memory performance (Henry, MacLeod, Phillips & Crawford, 2004; Luo & Craik, 2008).

This should not be surprising given the tendency of older adults to be more selective in where they place their physical, mental, and social energy. Having to remember a doctor’s appointment is of greater concern than remembering to hit the spacebar on a computer every time the word "tiger" is displayed.

#### Recall vs. Recognition

Memory performance often depends on whether older adults are asked to simply recognize previously learned material or recall material on their own. Generally, for all humans, recognition tasks are easier because they require less cognitive energy. Older adults show roughly equivalent memory to young adults when assessed with a recognition task (Rhodes, Castel, & Jacoby, 2008). With recall measures, older adults show memory deficits in comparison to younger adults. While the effect is initially not that large, starting at age 40 adults begin to show declines in recall memory compared to younger adults (Schwartz, 2011).

### The Age Advantage

Fewer age differences are observed when memory cues are available, such as for recognition memory tasks, or when individuals can draw upon acquired knowledge or experience. For example, older adults often perform as well, if not better, than young adults on tests of word knowledge or vocabulary. With age often comes expertise, and research has pointed to areas where aging experts perform quite well. For example, older typists were found to compensate for age-related declines in speed by looking farther ahead at the printed text (Salthouse, 1984). Compared to younger players, older chess experts focus on a smaller set of possible moves, leading to greater cognitive efficiency (Charness, 1981). Accrued knowledge of everyday tasks, such as grocery prices, can help older adults to make better decisions than young adults (Tentori, Osheron, Hasher, & May, 2001).

### Changes in Attention in Late Adulthood

Changes in sensory functioning and speed of processing information in late adulthood often translate into changes in attention (Jefferies et al., 2015). Research has shown that older adults are less able to selectively focus on information while ignoring distractors (Jefferies et al., 2015; Wascher et al., 2012), although Jefferies and her colleagues found that when given twice the time, older adults could perform at young-adult levels.   
  
Other studies have also found that older adults have greater difficulty shifting their attention between objects or locations (Tales et al., 2002). Consider the implication of these changes for older adults. 

How do changes or maintenance of cognitive ability affect older adults’ everyday lives? Researchers have studied cognition in the context of several different everyday activities. One example is driving. Although older adults often have more years of driving experience, cognitive declines related to reaction time or attentional processes may pose limitations under certain circumstances (Park & Gutchess, 2000).   
  
In contrast, research on interpersonal problem-solving suggested that older adults use more effective strategies than younger adults to navigate through social and emotional problems (Blanchard-Fields, 2007). In the context of work, researchers rarely find that older individuals perform poorer on the job (Park & Gutchess, 2000). Similar to everyday problem-solving, older workers may develop more efficient strategies and rely on expertise to compensate for cognitive decline. 

#### Problem-Solving

Problem-solving tasks that require processing non-meaningful information quickly (a kind of task that might be part of a laboratory experiment on mental processes) decline with age. However, many real-life challenges facing older adults do not rely on the speed of processing or making choices on one’s own. Older adults resolve everyday problems by relying on input from others, such as family and friends. They are also less likely than younger adults to delay making decisions on important matters, such as medical care (Strough et al., 2003; Meegan & Berg, 2002).

### Causes of Deficits in Aging Adults 

The **processing speed theory,** proposed by Salthouse (1996, 2004), suggests that as the nervous system slows with advanced age, the ability to process information declines. This slowing of processing speed may explain age differences on many different cognitive tasks. For instance, as people age, working memory becomes less efficient (Craik & Bialystok, 2006). Older adults also need longer time to complete mental tasks or make decisions. Yet, when given sufficient time, older adults perform as competently as young adults (Salthouse, 1996). Thus, when speed is not imperative to the task, healthy older adults do not show cognitive declines.

In contrast, **inhibition theory** argues that older adults have difficulty with inhibitory functioning, or the ability to focus on certain information while suppressing attention to less pertinent information tasks (Hasher & Zacks, 1988). Evidence comes from directed forgetting research. In **directed forgetting,** people are asked to forget or ignore some information, but not other information.

For example, you might be asked to memorize a list of words but are then told that the researcher made a mistake and gave you the wrong list and asks you to "forget" this list. You are then given a second list to memorize. While most people do well at forgetting the first list, older adults are more likely to recall more words from the "forget-to-recall" list than younger adults (Andrés et al., 2004). 

#### Cognitive Losses Exaggerated

While there are information processing losses in late adulthood, overall loss has been exaggerated (Garrett, 2015). One explanation is that the type of tasks that people are tested on tend to be meaningless. For example, older individuals are not motivated to remember a random list of words in a study, but they are motivated toward more meaningful material related to their life, and consequently perform better on such tests.

Another reason is that the research is often cross-sectional. When age comparisons occur longitudinally, however, the amount of loss diminishes (Schaie, 1994). A third reason is that the loss may be due to a lack of opportunity in using various skills. When older adults practiced skills, they performed as well as they had previously. 

Although diminished performance speed is especially noteworthy in the elderly, Schaie (1994) found that statistically removing the effects of speed diminished the individual’s performance declines significantly. In fact, Salthouse and Babcock (1991) demonstrated that processing speed accounted for all but 1 percent of age-related differences in working memory when testing individuals from 18 to 82.

Finally, it is well established that hearing and vision decline with age. Longitudinal research has proposed that deficits in sensory functioning explain age differences in a variety of cognitive abilities (Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997). Not surprisingly, more years of education, and subsequently higher income, are associated with higher cognitive level and slower cognitive decline (Zahodne et al., 2015).

### Intelligence and Wisdom

#### Intelligence 

Botwinick (1984) looked at older adults' scores on traditional intelligence tests and found that tasks involving verbal skills showed few age-related declines, while tasks involving solving problems quickly did show decline with age. This profile mirrors crystallized and fluid intelligence.   
  
Crystallized intelligence encompasses abilities that draw upon experience and knowledge. Measures of crystallized intelligence include vocabulary tests, solving number problems, and understanding texts. Fluid intelligence refers to information processing abilities, such as logical reasoning, remembering lists, spatial ability, and reaction time.   
  
Baltes (1993) introduced two additional types of intelligence to reflect cognitive changes in aging: **  
Pragmatics of intelligence** are cultural exposure to facts and procedures that are maintained as one ages and are similar to crystallized intelligence. **Mechanics of intelligence** are dependent on brain functioning and decline with age, similar to fluid intelligence.   
  
Baltes indicated that pragmatics of intelligence show a little decline and typically increase with age. Additionally, the pragmatics of intelligence may compensate for the declines that occur with the mechanics of intelligence. In summary, global cognitive declines are not typical as one ages, and individuals compensate for some cognitive declines, especially processing speed.

#### Wisdom 

**Wisdom** is the ability to use the accumulated knowledge about practical matters that allows for sound judgment and decision-making. A wise person is insightful and has knowledge that can be used to overcome obstacles in living. Does aging bring wisdom?   
  
While living longer brings experience, it does not always bring wisdom. Paul Baltes and his colleagues (Baltes & Kunzmann, 2004; Baltes & Staudinger, 2000) suggest that wisdom is rare. In addition, the emergence of wisdom can be seen in late adolescence and young adulthood, with there being few gains in wisdom over the course of adulthood (Staudinger & Gluck, 2011).   
  
This would suggest that factors other than age are stronger determinants of wisdom. Occupations and experiences that emphasize others rather than self, along with personality characteristics, such as openness to experience and generativity, are more likely to provide the building blocks of wisdom (Baltes & Kunzmann, 2004). Age combined with certain types of experience and personality brings wisdom.

### Neurocognitive Disorders

Historically, the term "dementia" was used to refer to an individual experiencing difficulties with memory, language, abstract thinking, reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving (Erber & Szuchman (2015). However, in the latest edition of the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), the term dementia has been replaced by the term "neurocognitive disorder."  
  
A **major neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed as a significant cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or more cognitive domains, one that interferes with independent functioning.   
  
A **minor neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed as a modest cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or more cognitive domains and does not interfere with independent functioning.   
  
There are several different neurocognitive disorders that are typically demonstrated in late adulthood. Determining the exact type can be difficult because the symptoms may overlap with each other. Diagnosis often includes a medical history, physical exam, laboratory tests, and changes noted in behavior. Alzheimer's disease, vascular neurocognitive disorder, and neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies will be discussed below. 

### Alzheimer's Disease

Probably the most well-known and most common neurocognitive disorder for older individuals is Alzheimer's disease. In 2016, an estimated 5.4 million Americans were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (Alzheimer’s Association, 2016), which was approximately one in nine aged 65 and over.

Alzheimer's disease has a gradual onset with subtle personality changes and memory loss that differs from normal age-related memory problems occurring first. Confusion, difficulty with change, and deterioration in language, problem-solving skills, and personality become evident next. In the later stages, the individual loses physical coordination and is unable to complete everyday tasks, including self-care and personal hygiene (Erber & Szuchman, 2015).   
  
Lastly, individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, to carry on a conversation, and eventually to control movement (Alzheimer’s Association, 2016). On average, people with Alzheimer’s survive eight years, but some may live up to 20 years. The disease's course often depends on the individual's age and whether they have other health conditions.

The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is age, but there are genetic and environmental factors that can also contribute. Some forms of Alzheimer's are hereditary, and with the early onset type, several rare genes have been identified that directly cause Alzheimer's. People who inherit these genes tend to develop symptoms in their thirties, forties, and fifties. Five percent of those identified with Alzheimer’s disease are younger than age 65.   
  
When Alzheimer's disease is caused by deterministic genes, it is called familial Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2016). Traumatic brain injury is also a risk factor, as well as obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes (Carlson, 2011).

### Βeta Amyloid and Tau

According to Erber and Szuchman (2015), the problems that occur with Alzheimer's disease are due to the "death of neurons, the breakdown of connections between them, and the extensive formation of **plaques **and **tau**, which interfere with neuron functioning and neuron survival."   
  
Plaques are abnormal formations of protein pieces called **beta-amyloid**. Beta-amyloid comes from a larger protein found in the fatty membrane surrounding nerve cells. Because beta-amyloid is sticky, it builds up into plaques (Alzheimer's Association, 2016). These plaques appear to block cell communication and may also trigger an inflammatory response in the immune system, which leads to further neuronal death.   
  
Tau is an important protein that helps maintain the brain's transport system. When tau malfunctions, it changes into twisted strands called tangles that disrupt the transport system. Consequently, nutrients and other supplies cannot move through the cells and they eventually die. The death of neurons leads to the brain shrinking and affecting all aspects of brain functioning.   
  
For example, the hippocampus is involved in learning and memory, and the brain cells in this region are often the first to be damaged. This is why memory loss is often one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

#### Research

Washington University School of Medicine (2019) reported that its researchers discovered that failing immune cells, known as **microglia**, appear to be the link between amyloid and tau, which are the two damaging proteins of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid plaques, which appear first, do not cause Alzheimer's, but the presence of amyloid leads to the formation of **tau tangles**, which are responsible for the memory loss and cognitive deficits seen in those with Alzheimer's disease.   
  
It appears that weakening microglia cause the amyloid plaques to injure nearby neurons, thus creating a toxic environment that increases the formation and spread of tau tangles. These findings could lead to a new approach for developing therapies for Alzheimer's.

### Sleep Deprivation and Alzheimer’s

Studies suggest that sleep plays a role in clearing both beta-amyloid and tau out of the brain. Shokri-Kojori et al. (2018) scanned participants' brains after 1) getting a full night's rest and 2) after 31 hours without sleep. Beta-amyloid increased about 5 percent in the participants' brains after losing a night of sleep. These changes occurred in brain regions that included the thalamus and hippocampus, which are associated with the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

Shokri-Kojori et al. (2018) also found that participants with the largest increases in beta-amyloid reported the worst mood after sleep deprivation. These findings support other studies that have found that the hippocampus and thalamus are involved in mood disorders. 

Additionally, Holth et al. (2019) found that healthy adults who remained awake all day and night, had tau levels that were elevated by about 50 percent. Once tau begins to accumulate in brain tissue, the protein can spread from one brain area to the next along neural connections. Holth et al. also found that older people who had more tau tangles in their brains had less slow-wave, deep sleep.

Holth et al. (2019) concluded that good sleep habits or treatments designed to encourage plenty of high-quality sleep might play an important role in slowing Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, poor sleep might worsen the condition and serve as an early warning sign of Alzheimer's disease. 

#### Healthy Lifestyle Combats Alzheimer's

Dhana and colleagues with the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago examined how a healthy lifestyle mitigates the risk of Alzheimer's disease (Natanson, 2019). The researchers followed a diverse group of 2,765 participants for nine years and focused on five low-risk lifestyle factors: healthy diet, at least 150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity, not smoking, light to moderate alcohol intake, and engaging in cognitively stimulating activities.

Results indicated that those who adopted four or five low-risk lifestyle factors had a 60 percent lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease when compared with participants who did not follow any or only one of the low-risk factors. The authors concluded that incorporating these lifestyle changes can have a positive effect on one's brain functioning and lower the risk for Alzheimer's disease.

### Other Neurocognitive Disorders

#### Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder

**Vascular neurocognitive disorder** is the second most common neurocognitive disorder affecting 0.2 percent in the 65-to-70-year-old age group and 16 percent of individuals 80 years and older (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Vascular neurocognitive disorder is associated with a blockage of cerebral blood vessels that affects one part of the brain rather than a general loss of brain cells seen with Alzheimer’s disease. Personality is not as affected in vascular neurocognitive disorder, and more males are diagnosed than females (Erber and Szuchman, 2015). It also comes on more abruptly than Alzheimer's disease and has a shorter course before death. Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and a history of strokes. 

#### Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy bodies

According to the National Institute on Aging (2015a), **Lewy bodies** are microscopic protein deposits found in neurons; they are only seen in autopsies, following death. They affect chemicals in the brain that can lead to difficulties in thinking, movement, behavior, and mood.

Neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies is the third most common form and affects more than a million Americans. It typically begins at age 50 or older and appears to affect slightly more men than women. The disease lasts approximately five to seven years from the time of diagnosis to death but can range from 2 to 20 years, depending on the individual's age, health, and severity of symptoms.

Lewy bodies can occur in both the cortex and brain stem, which results in cognitive as well as motor symptoms (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). The movement symptoms are similar to those with Parkinson's disease and include tremors and muscle rigidity. However, the motor disturbances occur at the same time as the cognitive symptoms, unlike with Parkinson's disease when the cognitive symptoms occur well after the motor symptoms. Individuals diagnosed with neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies also experience sleep disturbances, recurrent visual hallucinations, and risk of falling.

### Lesson 7: Introduction

This lesson focuses on psychosocial development in early adulthood, from mid-twenties to mid-forties. Topics included gender, sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, and sexual orientation and how it is viewed in various cultures, sometimes in a discriminatory light.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain typical psychosocial development during early adulthood.

### Emerging Adulthood Defined

Emerging adulthood is the period between late teens and early twenties—roughly ages 18 to 25, although some researchers have included up to age 29 in the definition (Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood, 2016). Jeffrey Arnett (2000) argues that emerging adulthood is neither adolescence nor is it young adulthood. Individuals in this period have left behind the relative dependency of childhood and adolescence but have not yet taken on the responsibilities of adulthood.   
  
"Emerging adulthood is a time of life when many different directions remain possible, when little about the future is decided for certain, when the scope of independent exploration of life's possibilities is greater for most people than it will be at any other period of the life course" (Arnett, 2000, p. 469). Arnett identified five characteristics of emerging adulthood that distinguished it from adolescence and young adulthood (Arnett, 2006). 

- AGE OF IDENTITY EXPLORATION. In 1950, Erik Erikson proposed that it was during adolescence that humans wrestled with the question of identity. Yet, even Erikson (1968) commented on a trend during the twentieth century of a "prolonged adolescence" in industrialized societies. Today, most identity development occurs during the late teens and early twenties rather than adolescence. It is during emerging adulthood that people are exploring career choices and ideas about intimate relationships, setting the foundation for adulthood. 
- AGE OF INSTABILITY. Arnett also described this time period as the age of instability (Arnett, 2000; Arnett, 2006). Exploration generates uncertainty and instability. Emerging adults change jobs, relationships, and residences more frequently than other age groups. 
- AGE OF SELF-FOCUS. Being self-focused is not the same as being "self-centered." Adolescents are more self-centered than emerging adults. Arnett reports that in his research, he found emerging adults to be very considerate of the feelings of others, especially their parents. They now begin to see their parents as *people*, something most adolescents fail to do (Arnett, 2006). Nonetheless, emerging adults focus more on themselves, as they realize that they have few obligations to others and this is the time when they can do what they want with their life. 
- AGE OF FEELING IN-BETWEEN. When asked if they feel like adults, more 18- to 25-year-olds answer "yes *and *no'' than teens or adults over the age of 25 (Arnett, 2001). Most emerging adults have gone through the changes of puberty, are typically no longer in high school, and many have also moved out of their parents' home. Thus, they no longer feel as dependent as they did as teenagers.   
  
Yet, they may still be financially dependent on their parents to some degree, and they have not completely attained some of the indicators of adulthood, such as finishing their education, obtaining a good full-time job, being in a committed relationship, or being responsible for others. It is not surprising that Arnett found that 60 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds felt that in some ways they were adults, but in some ways, they were not (Arnett, 2001).
- AGE OF POSSIBILITIES. Emerging adulthood is a time of optimism as more 18- to 25-year-olds feel that they will someday get to where they want to be in life. Arnett (2000, 2006) suggests that this optimism is because these dreams have yet to be tested. For example, it is easier to believe that you will eventually find your soulmate when you have yet to have had a serious relationship.   
  
It may also be a chance to change directions for those whose lives, up to this point, have been difficult. The experiences of children and teens are influenced by the choices and decisions of their parents. If parents are dysfunctional, there is little a child can do about it. In emerging adulthood, people can move out and move on. They have the chance to transform their lives and move away from unhealthy environments. Even those whose lives were happy and fulfilling as children now have the opportunity in emerging adulthood to become independent and make decisions about the directions they would like their lives to take.

### Gender:

**Gender** is the cultural, social, and psychological meaning associated with masculinity and femininity. A person's sense of self as a member of a particular gender is known as **gender identity.** Because gender is considered a social construct—meaning that it does not exist naturally but is instead a concept that is created by cultural and societal norms—there are cultural variations on how people express their gender identity. 

#### Gender Roles

For many adults, the drive to adhere to masculine and feminine **gender roles **the societal expectations associated with being male or female continues throughout life. In American culture, masculine roles have traditionally been associated with strength, aggression, and dominance, while feminine roles have traditionally been associated with passivity, nurturing, and subordination.

Men tend to outnumber women in professions such as law enforcement, the military, and politics, while women tend to outnumber men in care-related occupations such as childcare, healthcare, and social work. These occupational roles are examples of stereotypical American male and female behavior, derived not from biology or genetics, but from our culture's traditions. Adherence to these roles may demonstrate fulfillment of social expectations, however, not necessarily personal preferences (Diamond, 2002).

Consequently, many adults are challenging gender labels and roles, and the long-standing **gender binary;** that is, categorizing humans as only female and male has been undermined by current psychological research (Hyde, Bigler, Joel, Tate, & van Anders, 2019).

The term *gender* now encompasses a wide range of possible identities, including cisgender, transgender, agender, genderfluid, genderqueer, gender nonconforming, bigender, pangender, ambigender, nongendered, intergender, and **two-spirit**—a modern umbrella term used by some indigenous North Americans to describe gender-variant individuals in their communities (Carroll, 2016). Hyde et al. (2019) advocate for a conception of gender that stresses multiplicity and diversity and uses multiple categories that are not mutually exclusive.

#### Gender Minority Discrimination

Gender nonconforming people are much more likely to experience harassment, bullying, and violence based on their gender identity; they also experience much higher rates of discrimination in housing, employment, healthcare, and education (Borgogna et al., 2019; National Center for Transgender Equality, 2015). Transgender individuals of color face additional financial, social, and interpersonal challenges, in comparison to the transgender community as a whole, as a result of structural racism.   
  
Black transgender people reported the highest level of discrimination among all transgender individuals of color. As members of several intersecting minority groups, transgender people of color—and transgender women of color in particular—are especially vulnerable to employment discrimination, poor health outcomes, harassment, and violence. Consequently, they face even greater obstacles than white transgender individuals and cisgender members of their own race.

#### Gender Minority Status and Mental Health

Using data from over 43,000 college students, Borgona et al. (2019) examined mental health differences among several gender groups, including those identifying as cisgender, transgender, and gender nonconforming. Results indicated that participants who identified as transgender and gender nonconforming had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression than those identifying as cisgender.

Bargona et al. (2019) explained the higher rates of anxiety and depression using the **minority stress model,** which states that an unaccepting social environment results in both external and internal stress that contributes to poorer mental health. External stressors include discrimination, harassment, and prejudice, while internal stressors include negative thoughts, feelings, and emotions resulting from one's identity. Borgona et al. (2019) recommend that mental health services that are sensitive to both gender minority and sexual minority status be available.

### Sexuality

**Human sexuality** refers to people's sexual interest in and attraction to others, as well as their capacity to have erotic experiences and responses. Sexuality may be experienced and expressed in a variety of ways, including thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviors, practices, roles, and relationships. These may manifest themselves in biological, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual aspects.   
  
The biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely concern human reproductive functions, including the human sexual-response cycle and the basic biological drive that exists in all species. Emotional aspects of sexuality include bonds between individuals that are expressed through profound feelings or physical manifestations of love, trust, and care. Social aspects deal with the effects of human society on one's sexuality, while spirituality concerns an individual's spiritual connection with others through sexuality. Sexuality also impacts and is impacted by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and religious aspects of life. 

#### The Sexual Response Cycle

Sexual motivation, often referred to as **libido,** is a person's overall sexual drive or desire for sexual activity. This motivation is determined by biological, psychological, and social factors. In most mammalian species, sex hormones control the ability to engage in sexual behaviors. However, sex hormones do not directly regulate the ability to copulate in primates (including humans); rather, they are only one influence on the motivation to engage in sexual behaviors.   
  
Social factors, such as work and family, also have an impact, as do internal psychological factors like personality and stress. Sex drive may also be affected by hormones, medical conditions, medications, lifestyle stress, pregnancy, and relationship issues. 

The **sexual response cycle** is a model that describes the physiological responses that take place during sexual activity. According to Kinsey et al. (1948), the cycle consists of four phases. The **excitement phase** is the phase in which the intrinsic (inner) motivation to pursue sex arises. The **plateau****phase** is the period of sexual excitement with increased heart rate and circulation that sets the stage for orgasm. **Orgasm** is the release of tension, and the **resolution period** is the unaroused state before the cycle begins again.

#### The Brain and Sex

The brain is the structure that translates nerve impulses from the skin into pleasurable sensations. It controls nerves and muscles used during sexual behavior. The brain regulates the release of hormones, which are believed to be the physiological origin of sexual desire. The cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain that allows for thinking and reasoning, is believed to be the origin of sexual thoughts and fantasies.   
  
Beneath the cortex is the limbic system, which consists of the amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and septal area. These structures are where emotions and feelings are believed to originate, and they are important for sexual behavior. 

The **hypothalamus** is the most important part of the brain for sexual functioning. This is the small area at the base of the brain consisting of several groups of nerve-cell bodies that receive input from the limbic system. Studies with lab animals have shown that destruction of certain areas of the hypothalamus causes complete elimination of sexual behavior.   
  
One of the reasons for the importance of the hypothalamus is that it controls the pituitary gland, which secretes hormones that control the other glands of the body.

#### Hormones

Several important sexual hormones are secreted by the pituitary gland. **Oxytocin,** also known as the hormone of love, is released during sexual intercourse when an orgasm is achieved. Oxytocin is also released in females when they give birth or are breastfeeding; it is believed that oxytocin is involved with maintaining close relationships. Both prolactin and oxytocin stimulate milk production in females.   
  
**Follicle-stimulating hormone** is responsible for ovulation in females by triggering egg maturity; it also stimulates sperm production in males. **Luteinizing hormone** triggers the release of a mature egg in females during the process of ovulation. 

In males, testosterone appears to be a major contributing factor to sexual motivation. Vasopressin is involved in the male arousal phase, and the increase of **vasopressin** during erectile response may be directly associated with increased motivation to engage in sexual behavior. 

The relationship between hormones and female sexual motivation is not as well understood, largely due to the overemphasis on male sexuality in Western research. **Estrogen** and **progesterone** typically regulate motivation to engage in sexual behavior for females, with estrogen increasing motivation and progesterone decreasing it.   
  
The levels of these hormones rise and fall throughout a woman's menstrual cycle. Research suggests that testosterone, oxytocin, and vasopressin are also implicated in female sexual motivation in similar ways as they are in males, but more research is needed to understand these relationships.

#### Sexual Responsiveness Peak

Men and women tend to reach their peak of sexual responsiveness at different ages. For men, sexual responsiveness tends to peak in the late teens and early twenties. Sexual arousal can easily occur in response to physical stimulation or fantasizing. Sexual responsiveness begins a slow decline in the late twenties and into the thirties, although a man may continue to be sexually active. Through time, a man may require more intense stimulation in order to become aroused.   
  
Women often find that they become more sexually responsive throughout their twenties and thirties and may peak in the late thirties or early forties. This is likely due to greater self-confidence and reduced inhibitions about sexuality.

### Sexually Transmitted Infections

**Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)**—also referred to as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or venereal diseases (VDs)—are illnesses that have a significant probability of transmission by means of sexual behavior, including vaginal intercourse, anal sex, and oral sex. Some STIs can also be contracted by sharing intravenous drug needles with an infected person, as well as through childbirth or breastfeeding. 

Common STIs include: 

- chlamydia 
- herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2)
- human papillomavirus (HPV)
- gonorrhea 
- syphilis
- trichomoniasis
- HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)
- AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2014), there was an increase in the three most common types of STIs in 2014. These include 1.4 million cases of chlamydia, 350,000 cases of gonorrhea, and 20,000 cases of syphilis. Those most affected by STIs include younger gay or bisexual males and females.

The most effective way to prevent transmission of STIs is to practice safe sex and avoid direct contact of skin or fluids, which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Proper use of safe-sex supplies (male condoms, female condoms, gloves, or dental dams) reduces contact and risk and can be effective in limiting exposure; however, some disease transmission may occur even with these barriers.

#### Societal Views on Sexuality

Society's views on sexuality are influenced by everything from religion to philosophy, and they have changed throughout history and are continuously evolving. Historically, religion has been the greatest influence on sexual behavior in the United States; however, in more recent years, peers and the media have emerged as two of the strongest influences, particularly among American teens (Potard et al., 2008). 

Mass media in the form of television, magazines, movies, and music continues to shape what is deemed appropriate or normal sexuality, targeting everything from body image to products meant to enhance sex appeal. Media perpetuates a number of social scripts about sexual relationships and the sexual roles of men and women, many of which have been shown to have both empowering and problematic effects on people's (especially women's) developing sexual identities and sexual attitudes.

Key Terms

- **sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **illnesses that have a significant probability of transmission by means of sex, including vaginal intercourse, anal sex, and oral sex

### Cultural Differences

In the West, premarital sex is normative by the late teens, more than a decade before most people enter marriage. In the United States and Canada, and in Northern and Eastern Europe, cohabitation is also normative; most people have at least one cohabiting partnership before marriage. In southern Europe, cohabiting is still taboo, but premarital sex is tolerated in emerging adulthood.   
  
In contrast, both premarital sex and cohabitation remain rare and forbidden throughout Asia. Even dating is discouraged until the late twenties, when it would be a prelude to a serious relationship leading to marriage. In cross-cultural comparisons, about three-fourths of emerging adults in the United States and Europe report having had premarital sexual relations by age 20, less than one-fifth in Japan and South Korea (Hatfield & Rapson, 2006). 

#### Sexual Orientation

A person's **sexual orientation** is the emotional and sexual attraction to a particular gender. It is a personal quality that inclines people to feel romantic or sexual attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of a given sex or gender. According to the American Psychological Association (APA) (2016), sexual orientation also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.   
  
Sexual orientation is independent of gender; for example, a transgender person may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, polysexual, asexual, or any other kind of sexuality, just like a cisgender person.

#### Sexual Orientation on a Continuum

Sexuality researcher Alfred Kinsey was among the first to conceptualize sexuality as a continuum rather than a strict dichotomy of gay or straight. To classify this continuum of heterosexuality and homosexuality, Kinsey et al. (1948) created a seven-point rating scale that ranged from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual. Research done over several decades has supported this idea that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex/gender to exclusive attraction to the same sex/gender (Carroll, 2016).

Sexual orientation now can be defined in many ways. **Heterosexuality**—which is often referred to as being straight—is attraction to individuals of the opposite sex/gender, while **homosexuality**—being gay or lesbian—is attraction to individuals of one's own sex/gender.   
  
**Bisexuality** was a term traditionally used to refer to attraction to individuals of either male or female sex, but it has recently been used in nonbinary models of sex and gender (that is, models that do not assume there are only two sexes or two genders) to refer to attraction to any sex or gender. Alternative terms such as **pansexuality** and **polysexuality** have also been developed, referring to attraction to all sexes/genders and attraction to multiple sexes/genders, respectively (Carroll, 2016).

**Asexuality** refers to having no sexual attraction to any sex/gender. According to Bogaert (2015), about 1 percent of the population is asexual. Being asexual is not due to any physical problems, and the lack of interest in sex does not cause the individual any distress. Asexuality is being researched as a distinct sexual orientation.

#### Development of a Sexual Orientation

According to current scientific understanding, individuals are usually aware of their sexual orientation between middle childhood and early adolescence. However, this is not always the case, and some do not become aware of their sexual orientation until much later in life.   
  
It is not necessary to participate in sexual activity to be aware of these emotional, romantic, and physical attractions; people can be celibate and still recognize their sexual orientation. Some researchers argue that sexual orientation is not static and inborn but is instead fluid and changeable throughout the life span.  
  

#### Reasons for Sexual Orientation

There is no scientific consensus regarding the exact reasons why an individual holds a particular sexual orientation. Research has examined possible biological, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, but there has been no evidence that links sexual orientation to only one factor. However, biological explanations, including genetics, birth order, and hormones will be explored further as many scientists support biological processes occurring during the embryonic and early postnatal life as playing the main role in sexual orientation.

### Genetics, Birth Order, and Hormones

#### Genetics

Using both twin and familial studies, heredity provides one biological explanation for same-sex orientation. One study of pairs of male twins found that the likelihood that identical twins would both have a same-sex orientation was 52 percent, while the rate for fraternal twins was only 22 percent. Another set of researchers studied female twins and found a similar difference of 48 percent for identical twins both with a same-sex orientation and 16 percent for fraternal twins. Yet another study found that gay men had more gay male relatives than straight men, and sisters of gay men were more likely to be lesbians than sisters of straight men.

#### Fraternal Birth Order

The fraternal birth order effect indicates that the probability of a boy identifying as gay increases for each older brother born to the same mother. One researcher found that “… the increased incidence of homosexuality in males with older brothers results from a progressive immunization of the mother against a male specific cell-adhesion protein that plays a key role in cell-cell interactions, specifically in the process of synapse formation.” A meta-analysis indicated that the fraternal birth order effect explains the sexual orientation of between 15 and 29 percent of gay men. 

#### Hormones

Excess or deficient exposure to hormones during prenatal development has also been theorized as an explanation for sexual orientation. One-third of females exposed to abnormal amounts of prenatal androgens, a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia, identify as bisexual or lesbian. In contrast, too little exposure to prenatal androgens may affect male sexual orientation by not masculinizing the male brain.

### Sexual Orientation Discrimination

The United States is **heteronormative,** meaning that society supports heterosexuality as the norm. Consider, for example, that homosexuals are often asked, "When did you know you were gay?" but heterosexuals are rarely asked, "When did you know you were straight?" (Ryle, 2011). Living in a culture that privileges heterosexuality has a significant impact on the ways in which non-heterosexual people are able to develop and express their sexuality.

Open identification of one's sexual orientation may be hindered by **homophobia,** which encompasses a range of negative attitudes and feelings toward homosexuality or people who are identified or perceived as being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). It can be expressed as antipathy, contempt, prejudice, aversion, or hatred; it may be based on irrational fear and is sometimes related to religious beliefs (Carroll, 2016).   
  
Homophobia is observable in critical and hostile behavior, such as discrimination and violence on the basis of sexual orientations that are nonheterosexual. Recognized types of homophobia include **institutionalized homophobia**—religious and state-sponsored homophobia—and **internalized homophobia,** in which people with same-sex attractions internalize, or believe, society's negative views and/or hatred of themselves. 

#### Sexual Minorities

Sexual minorities regularly experience stigma, harassment, discrimination, and violence based on their sexual orientation (Carroll, 2016). Research has shown that gay, lesbian, and bisexual teenagers are at a higher risk of depression and suicide due to exclusion from social groups, rejection from peers and family, and negative media portrayals of homosexuals (Bauermeister et al., 2010).   
  
Discrimination can occur in the workplace, in housing, at schools, and in numerous public settings. Much of this discrimination is based on stereotypes and misinformation. Major policies to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation have only come into effect in the United States in the last few years. 

The majority of empirical and clinical research on LGBT populations are done with largely white, middle-class, well-educated samples. This demographic limits our understanding of more marginalized sub-populations that are also affected by racism, classism, and other forms of oppression.   
  
In the United States, non-White LGBT individuals may find themselves in a double minority, in which they are not fully accepted or understood by White LGBT communities, nor accepted by their own ethnic group (Tye, 2006). Many people experience racism in the dominant LGBT community where racial stereotypes merge with gender stereotypes.

### Lesson 8: Introduction

In this lesson you will learn about common aspects of psychosocial development in middle adulthood. 

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain typical psychosocial development during middle adulthood.

### Generativity 

According to Erikson (1950, 1982), generativity encompasses** procreativity,** productivity, and creativity. This stage includes the generation of new beings, new products, and new ideas, as well as self-generation concerned with further identity development. Erikson believed that the stage of generativity, during which one established a family and career, was the longest of all the stages. Individuals at midlife are primarily concerned with leaving a positive legacy of themselves, and parenthood is the primary generative type. Erikson understood that work and family relationships may be in **conflict** due to the obligations and responsibilities of each, but he believed it was overall a positive developmental time. In addition to being parents and working, Erikson also described individuals being involved in the community during this stage. A sense of stagnation occurs when one is not active in generative matters, however, stagnation can motivate a person to redirect energies into more meaningful activities.

#### Virtues of Generativity

Erikson identified "virtues" for each of his eight stages, and the virtue emerging when one achieves generativity is "care." Erikson believed that those in middle adulthood should "take care of the persons, the products, and the ideas one has learned to care for" (Erikson, 1982, p. 67). Further, Erikson believed that the strengths gained from the six earlier stages are essential for the generational task of cultivating strength in the next generation. Erikson further argued that generativity occurred best after the individual had resolved issues of identity and intimacy (Peterson & Duncan, 2007).

#### Characteristics of Generativity

Research has demonstrated that generative adults possess many positive characteristics, including good cultural knowledge and healthy adaptation to the world (Peterson & Duncan, 2007). Using the Big 5 personality traits, generative women and men scored high on conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience, and low on neuroticism (de St. Aubin & McAdams, 1995; Peterson, Smirles, & Wentworth, 1997). Additionally, women scoring high in generativity at age 52 were rated high in positive personality characteristics, satisfaction with marriage and motherhood, and successful aging at age 62 (Peterson & Duncan, 2007). Similarly, men rated higher in generativity at midlife were associated with stronger global **cognitive functioning** (memory, attention, calculation), stronger **executive functioning** (response inhibition, abstract thinking, cognitive flexibility), and lower levels of depression in late adulthood (Malone, Liu, Vaillant, Rentz, & Waldinger, 2016).

#### Challenges of Generativity

Erikson (1982) indicated that at the end of this demanding stage, individuals may withdraw as generativity is no longer expected in late adulthood. This releases elders from the task of caretaking or working. However, not feeling needed or challenged may result in stagnation and, consequently, one should not fully withdraw from generative tasks as they enter Erikson's last stage in late adulthood.

### Sandwich Generation

The "**sandwich generation**" refers to adults who have at least one parent age 65 or older and are either raising their own children or providing support for their grown children. According to a recent Pew Research survey, 47 percent of middle-aged adults are part of this sandwich generation (Parker & Patten, 2013). In addition, 15 percent of middle-aged adults are providing financial support to an older parent while raising or supporting their own children. According to the same survey, almost half (48 percent) of middle-aged adults have supported their adult children in the past year, and 27 percent are the primary source of support for their grown children. 

Seventy-one percent of the sandwich generation is aged 40 to 59, 19 percent were younger than 40, and 10 percent were 60 or older. Hispanics are more likely to find themselves supporting two generations; 31 percent have parents 65 or older and a dependent child, compared with 24 percent of Whites and 21 percent of Blacks (Parker & Patten, 2013). Women are more likely to take on the role of care provider for older parents in the United States and Germany (Pew Research, 2015). About 20 percent of women say they have helped with personal care, such as getting dressed or bathing, of aging parents in the past year, compared with 8% of men in the United States and 4 percent in Germany. In contrast, in Italy men are just as likely (25 percent) as women (26 percent) to have provided personal care.

#### Pew Survey

The Pew Survey found that almost 33 percent of the sandwich generation adults were more likely to say they always feel rushed, while only 23 percent of other adults said this. However, the survey suggests that those who were supporting both parents and children reported being just as happy as those middle-aged adults who did not find themselves in the sandwich generation (Parker & Patten, 2013). Adults who are supporting both parents and children did report greater financial strain. Only 28 percent reported that they were living comfortably versus 41 percent of those who were not also supporting their parents. Almost 33 percent were just making ends meet, compared with 17 percent of those who did not have the additional financial burden of aging parents.

### Kinkeeper

At midlife, adults may find themselves as a kinkeeper. In all families, there is a person or persons who keep the family connected and who promote solidarity and continuity in the family (Brown & DeRycke, 2010).   
  
Who in your own family do you count on to organize family gatherings? Who knows the history of your family? Who do people turn to in your family for advice and support? Who works to strengthen the bonds between members of your family? These are your family's kinkeepers, and they are usually women (Leach & Braithwaite, 1996; Brown & DeRycke, 2010). Leach and Braithwaite found that 86 percent of their respondents named a woman as their family's kinkeeper, and Brown and DeRycke found that mothers, maternal grandmothers, and paternal grandmothers were more likely to be a family's kinkeeper than were fathers, young adult children, and grandfathers combined. Brown and DeRycke also found that among young adults, women were more likely to be a kinkeeper than were young adult men. 

Kinkeeping can be a source of distress when it interferes with other obligations (Gerstel & Gallagher, 1993). Gerstel and Gallagher found that on average, kinkeepers provide almost a full week of work each month to kinkeeping (almost 34 hours). They also found that the more activities the kinkeeper took on, and the more kin they helped, the more stress and higher the levels of depression they experienced. However, unlike other studies on kinkeeping, Gerstel and Gallagher also included a number of activities that would be considered more "caregiving," such as providing transportation, making repairs, providing meals, etc. in addition to the usual activities of kinkeeping.

### Empty Nest

The "**empty nest**" refers to the time period when children are grown up and have left home (Dennerstein, Dudley & Guthrie, 2002). For most parents this occurs during midlife. This time is recognized as a "normative event" as parents are aware that their children will become adults and eventually leave home (Mitchell & Lovegreen, 2009). The empty nest creates complex emotions, both positive and negative, for many parents. Some theorists suggest this is a time of role loss for parents, others suggest it is one of role strain relief (Bouchard, 2013).

#### Empty Nest Syndrome

The role loss hypothesis predicts that when people lose an important role in their life they experience a decrease in emotional well-being. It is from this perspective that the concept of the empty nest syndrome emerged, which refers to great **emotional distress** experienced by parents, typically mothers, after children have left home. The empty nest syndrome is linked to the absence of alternative roles for the parent in which they could establish their identity (Borland, 1982). In Bouchard's (2013) review of the research, she found that few parents reported loneliness or a big sense of loss once all their children had left home. 

In contrast, the role stress relief hypothesis suggests that the empty nest period should lead to more positive changes for parents, as the responsibility of raising children has been lifted. The role strain relief hypothesis was supported by many studies in Bouchard's (2013) review. A consistent finding throughout research literature is that raising children has a negative impact on the quality of marital relationships (Ahlborg, Misvaer, & Möller, 2009; Bouchard, 2013). Most studies have reported that marital satisfaction often increases during the launching phase of the empty nest period, and that this satisfaction endures long after the last child has left home (Gorchoff, John, & Helson, 2008).

### Empty-Nesters in China

However, most of the research on empty-nester parents has been with American parents. A number of studies in China suggest that empty-nesters, especially in more rural areas of China, report greater loneliness and depression than their counterparts with children still at home (Wu et al., 2010). Family support for the elderly by their children is a cherished Chinese tradition (Wong & Leung, 2012). With children moving from the rural communities to the larger cities for education and employment, this may explain the more pessimistic reaction of Chinese parents than in American samples. The loss of an adult child in a rural region may mean a loss of family income for aging parents. Empty-nesters in urban regions of China did not report the same degree of distress (Su et al., 2012), suggesting that it is not so much the event of children leaving, but the additional hardships this may place on aging parents. 

### Boomerang Kids

Young adults are living with their parents for a longer duration and in greater numbers than previous generations. In addition to those in early adulthood who are not leaving the home of their parents, there are also young adults who are returning after having lived independently outside the home, and these are called boomerang kids. A similar study showed that more young adults aged 18 to 34 in Europe were also living with their parents (Desilver, 2016).

Of the five distinct "generations" surveyed, the eldest (the "Silents," surveyed in 1964) and the Early Boomers (surveyed in 1981) lived at home as young people at the lowest rate, only 8 percent for each. Eleven percent of the Late Boomers, surveyed in 1990, lived at home. Ten percent of Gen Xers, surveyed in 2000, lived at home, and 15 percent of Millennials, surveyed in 2016, lived in a parent's home at that time. Many of the same financial reasons that are influencing young people's decisions to delay exit from the home of their parents are underlying their decisions to return home. In addition to financial reasons, some boomerang kids are returning because of emotional distress, such as mental health issues (Sandberg-Thoma, Snyder, & Jang, 2015). 

#### Relationship of Parents and Adult Children

What is the effect on parents when their adult children return home? Certainly, there is considerable research that shows the stress of raising children can have a negative impact on parents’ well-being, and that when children leave home many couples experience less stress and greater life satisfaction (see the section on the empty nest). Early research in the 1980s and 1990s supported the notion that boomerang children, along with those who were failing to exit the home, placed greater financial hardship on the parents, and the parents reported more negative perceptions of this living arrangement (Aquilino, 1991).

Recent surveys suggest that today's parents are more tolerant of this, perhaps because this is becoming a more normative experience than in the past. Moreover, children who return are more likely to have had good relationships with their parents growing up, so there may be less stress between parents and their adult children who return (Sandberg-Thoma et al., 2015). Parents of young adults who have moved back home because of economic reasons report that they are just as satisfied with their life as are parents whose adult children are still living independently (Parker, 2012). Parker found that adult children aged 25 and older are more likely to contribute financially to the family or complete chores and other household duties. Parker also found that living in a multigenerational household may be acting as an economic safety net for young adults. In comparison to young adults who were living outside of the home, those living with their parents were less likely to be living in poverty (17 percent versus 10 percent).

So far, the impact that adult children who have returned home or have yet to leave the nest have on the lives of middle-aged parents have been considered. What about the effect on parents who have adult children dealing with personal problems, such as alcoholism, chronic health concerns, mental health issues, trouble with the law, poor social relationships, or academic or job-related problems, even if they are not living at home?

One perspective proposes the idea of linked lives (Greenfield & Marks, 2006). This is the notion that people in important relationships, such as children and parents, mutually influence each other's developmental pathways. This relationship is bidirectional. The problems faced by children, even when those children are adults, influence the lives of their parents. Greenfield and Marks found in their study of middle-aged parents and their adult children, those parents whose children were dealing with personal problems reported more negative affect, lower self-acceptance, poorer parent-child interactions, and more family relationship stress. The more problems the adult children were facing, the worse the lives and emotional health of their parents, with single parents fearing the worst.

#### Overview

Read this to learn about romantic aspects of life in middle adulthood.

Singlehood

According to a Pew Research study, most U.S. adults marry. Only 16 out of 1,000 adults aged 45 to 54, and 7 out of 1,000 aged 55 and over had never married (Wang & Parker, 2014). However, some of them may be living with a partner. In addition, some singles at midlife may be single through divorce or widowhood.

DePaulo (2014) has challenged the idea that singles, especially the "always single," fare worse emotionally and in health when compared to those married. DePaulo suggests there is a bias in how studies examine the benefits of marriage. Most studies focus on comparisons between married versus not married, which do not include a separate comparison between those always single, and those who are single because of divorce or widowhood. Her research has found that those who are married may be more satisfied with life than the divorced or widowed**,** but there is little difference between married and always single, especially when comparing those who are recently married with those who have been married for four or more years. It appears that once the initial blush of the honeymoon wears off, those who are wedded are no happier or healthier than those who remained single. This might also suggest that there may be problems with how the "married" category is also seen as one homogeneous group.

### Online Dating

Montenegro (2003) surveyed over 3,000 singles aged 40 to 69, and almost half of the participants reported their most important reason for dating was to have someone to talk to or do things with. Additionally, sexual fulfillment was also identified as an important goal for many. Alterovitz & Mendelsohn (2013) reviewed online personal ads for men and women over age 40 and found that romantic activities and sexual interests were mentioned at similar rates among the middle-age and young-old age groups, but less for the old-old age group.

### Marriage

There have been a number of changes in the marriage rate as more people are cohabitating, more are deciding to stay single, and more are getting married at a later age. This makes marriage the most common relationship status for middle-aged adults in the United States.   
  
Marital satisfaction tends to increase for many couples in midlife as children are leaving home (Landsford et al., 2005). However, not all researchers agree. They suggest that those who are unhappy with their marriage are likely to have gotten divorced by now, making the quality of marriages later in life only look more satisfactory (Umberson et al., 2005). 

### Divorce

Livingston (2014) found that 27 percent of adults aged 45 to 54 were divorced. Additionally, 57 percent of divorced adults were women. This reflects the fact that men are more likely to remarry than women. Two-thirds of divorces are initiated by women (AARP, 2009).

Most divorces take place within the first 5 to 10 years of marriage. This timeline reflects people's initial attempts to salvage the relationship. After a few years of limited success, the couple may decide to end the marriage. It used to be that divorce after 20 or more years of marriage was rare, but in recent years the divorce rate among more long-term marriages has been increasing. Brown and Lin (2013) note that while the divorce rate in the U.S. has declined since the 1990s, the rate among those 50 and older has doubled.

They suggest several reasons for the "graying of divorce." There is less stigma attached to divorce today than in the past. Some older women are out-earning their spouses, and thus may be more financially capable of supporting themselves, especially as most of their children have grown. Finally, given increases in human longevity, the prospect of living several more years or decades with an incompatible spouse may prompt middle-aged and older adults to leave the marriage. 

#### Divorce Research

Gottman and Levenson (2000) found that the divorces in early adulthood were angrier and conflictual, with each partner blaming the other for the failures in the marriage. In contrast, they found that midlife divorces tended to be more about having grown apart, or a cooling off of the relationship.

A survey by AARP (2009) found that men and women had diverse motivations for getting a divorce. Women reported concerns about the verbal and physical abusiveness of their partner (23 percent), drug/alcohol abuse (18 percent), and infidelity (17 percent). In contrast, men mentioned they had simply fallen out of love (17 percent), no longer shared interests or values (14 percent), and infidelity (14 percent).

Both genders felt their marriage had been over long before the decision to divorce was made, with many of the middle-aged adults in the survey reporting that they stayed together because they were still raising children. Females also indicated that they remained in their marriage due to financial concerns, including the loss of health care (Sohn, 2015). However, only one in four adults regretted the decision to divorce.

#### Effects

The effects of divorce are varied. Overall, young adults struggle more with the consequences of divorce than those at midlife, as they have a higher risk of depression or other signs of problems with psychological adjustment (Birditt & Antonucci, 2013). Divorce at midlife is more stressful for women. In the AARP (2009) survey, 44 percent of middle-aged women mentioned financial problems after divorcing their spouse; in comparison, only 11 percent of men reported such difficulties.

However, a number of women who divorce in midlife report that they felt a great release from their day-to-day sense of unhappiness. Hetherington and Kelly (2002) found that among those who had used the experience to better themselves and seek more productive intimate relationships, and those who used their divorce experience to grow emotionally, but who chose to stay single, the overwhelming majority were women.

#### Dating Post-Divorce

Most divorced adults have dated by one year after filing for divorce (Anderson et al., 2004; Anderson & Greene, 2011). One in four recent filers report having been in or were currently in a serious relationship, and over half were in a serious relationship by one year after filing for divorce. Not surprisingly, younger adults were more likely to be dating than middle aged or older adults, no doubt due to the larger pool of potential partners from which they could draw.

Of course, these relationships will not all end in marriage. Teachman (2008) found that more than two-thirds of women under the age of 45 had cohabited with a partner between their first and second marriages. Dating for adults with children can be more of a challenge. Courtships are shorter in remarriage than in first marriages. When couples are "dating," there is less going out and more time spent in activities at home or with the children. So the couple gets less time together to focus on their relationship. Anxiety or memories of past relationships can also get in the way. As one Talmudic scholar suggests "when a divorced man marries a divorced woman, four go to bed" (Secombe & Warner, 2004).

Post-divorce parents **gatekeep;** that is, they regulate the flow of information about their new romantic partner to their children, in an attempt to balance their own needs for romance with consideration regarding the needs and reactions of their children. Anderson et al. (2004) found that almost half (47 percent) of dating parents gradually introduce their children to their dating partner, giving both their romantic partner and children time to adjust and get to know each other. Many parents who use this approach do so to avoid their children having to keep meeting someone new until it becomes clearer that this relationship might be more than casual.

It might also help if the adult relationship is on firmer ground so it can weather any initial push back from children when it is revealed. Forty percent are open and transparent about the new relationship at the outset with their children. Thirteen percent do not reveal the relationship until it is clear that cohabitation and or remarriage is likely. Anderson and colleagues suggest that practical matters influence which gatekeeping method parents may use. Parents may be able to successfully shield their children from a parade of suitors if there is reliable childcare available. The age and temperament of the child, along with concerns about the reaction of the ex-spouse, may also influence when parents reveal their romantic relationships to their children.

### Remarriage

#### Rates

The rate for remarriage, like the rate for marriage, has been declining overall. In 2013, the remarriage rate was approximately 28 per 1,000 adults 18 and older. This represents a 44 percent decline since 1990 and a 16 percent decline since 2008 (Payne, 2015). Brown and Lin (2013) found that the rate of remarriage dropped more for younger adults than middle-aged and older adults, and Livingston (2014) found that as people age, they are more likely to have remarried. This is not surprising as it takes some time to marry, divorce, and then find someone else to marry.

However, Livingston found that unlike those younger than 55, those 55 and up are remarrying at a higher rate than in the past. In 2013, 67 percent of adults 55 to 64 and 50 percent of adults 65 and older had remarried, up from 55 percent and 34 percent in 1960, respectively. Men have a higher rate of remarriage at every age group starting at age 25 (Payne, 2015). Livingston (2014) reported that in 2013, 64 percent of divorced or widowed men compared with 52 percent of divorced or widowed women had remarried. However, this gender gap has narrowed over time. Even though more men still remarry, they are remarrying at a slower rate. In contrast, women are remarrying today more than they did in 1980. This gender gap has closed mostly among young and middle-aged adults but still persists among those 65 and older. 

In 2012, Whites who were previously married were more likely to remarry than other racial and ethnic groups (Livingston, 2014). Moreover, the rate of remarriage has increased among Whites, while the rate of remarriage has declined for other racial and ethnic groups. This increase is driven by White women, whose rate of remarriage has increased, while the rate for White males has declined.

#### Success of Remarriages

Reviews are mixed as to the happiness and success of remarriages. While some remarriages are more successful, especially if the divorce motivated the adult to engage in self-improvement and personal growth, a number of divorced adults end up in very similar marriages the second or third time around (Hetherington & Kelly, 2002). Remarriages have challenges that are not found in first marriages that may create additional stress in the marital relationship. There can often be a general lack of clarity in family roles and expectations when trying to incorporate new kin into the family structure, even determining the appropriate terms for these kin, along with their roles can be a challenge. 

Partners may have to carefully navigate their role when dealing with their partners' children. All of this may lead to greater dissatisfaction and even resentment among family members. Even though remarried couples tend to have more realistic expectations for marriage, they tend to be less willing to stay in unhappy situations. The rate of divorce among remarriages is higher than among first marriages (Payne, 2015), which can add additional burdens, especially when children are involved.

#### Children’s Influence on Repartnering

Does having children affect whether a parent remarries? Goldscheider and Sassler (2006) found children residing with their mothers reduces the mothers' likelihood of marriage, only with respect to marrying a man without children. Further, having children in the home appears to increase single men's likelihood of marrying a woman with children (Stewart, Manning, & Smock, 2003). There is also some evidence that individuals who participated in a stepfamily while growing up may feel better prepared for stepfamily living as adults. Goldscheider and Kaufman (2006) found that having experienced family divorce as a child is associated with a greater willingness to marry a partner with children.

When children are present after divorce, one of the challenges the adults encounter is how much influence the child will have when selecting a new partner. Greene, Anderson, Hetherington, Forgatch, and DeGarmo (2003) identified two types of parents. The child-focused parent allows the child's views, reactions, and needs to influence the repartnering. In contrast, the adult-focused parent expects that their child can adapt and should accommodate parental wishes.

Anderson and Greene (2011) found that divorced custodial mothers identified as more adult-focused tended to be older, more educated, employed, and more likely to have been married longer. Additionally, adult-focused mothers reported having less rapport with their children, spent less time in joint activities with their children, and the child reported lower rapport with their mothers. Lastly, when the child and partner were resisting one another, adult-focused mothers responded more to the concerns of the partner, while the child-focused mothers responded more to the concerns of the child. Understanding the implications of these two differing perspectives can assist parents in their attempts to repartner.

### Roles of Grandparents

In addition to maintaining relationships with their children and aging parents, many people in middle adulthood take on yet another role, becoming a grandparent. The role of grandparents varies around the world. In **multigenerational** households, grandparents may play a greater role in the day-to-day activities of their grandchildren. While this family dynamic is more common in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, it has been on the increase in the United States (Pew Research Center, 2010). 

The degree of grandparent involvement also depends on the proximity of the grandparents' home to the grandchildren. In developed nations, the greater mobility of society can mean that grandparents may live long distances from their grandchildren. Technology has brought grandparents and their more distant grandchildren together. Sorenson and Cooper (2010) found that many of the grandfathers they interviewed would text, email, or video-chat with their grandchildren in order to stay in touch.

#### Grandparenting Styles

Cherlin and Furstenberg (1986) described three styles of grandparents. Thirty percent of grandparents were remote as they rarely saw their grandchildren. Usually they lived far away from the grandchildren, but may also have had a distant relationship. Contact was typically made on special occasions, such as holidays or birthdays.   
  
Fifty-five percent of grandparents were described as companionate as they did things with their grandchildren, but had little authority or control over them. They preferred to spend time with them without interfering in parenting. They were more like friends to their grandchildren.   
  
Fifteen percent of grandparents were described as involved, as they took a very active role in their grandchild's life. The involved grandparent had frequent contact with and authority over the grandchild, and their grandchildren might even have lived with them. Grandmothers, more so than grandfathers, played this role. In contrast, more grandfathers than grandmothers saw their role as family historian and family advisor (Neugarten and Weinstein, 1964).

#### Research of Bengtson

Bengtson (2001) suggests that grandparents adopt different styles with different grandchildren, and over time may change styles as circumstances in the family change. Today more grandparents are the sole care providers for grandchildren or may step in at times of crisis. With these changes grandparents are redefining how they see their role in the family with fewer adopting a more formal role (Hayslip et al., 2003).

#### Grandmothers and Grandfathers

Early research on grandparents has routinely focused on grandmothers, with grandfathers often becoming invisible members of the family (Sorensen & Cooper, 2010). Yet, grandfathers stress the importance of their relationships with their grandchildren as strongly as grandmothers (Waldrop et al., 1999). For some men, this may provide them with the opportunity to engage in activities that their occupations, as well as their generation's views of fatherhood and masculinity, kept them from engaging in with their own children (Sorenson & Cooper, 2010).   
  
Many of the grandfathers in Sorenson and Cooper's study felt that being a grandfather was easier and a lot more enjoyable. Even among grandfathers that took on a more involved role, there was still a greater sense that they could be more light-hearted and flexible in their interactions with their grandchildren. Many grandfathers reported that they were more openly affectionate with their grandchildren than they had been with their own children.

### Religion and Spirituality

Grzywacz and Keyes (2004) found that in addition to personal health behaviors, such as regular exercise, healthy weight, not smoking, and social behaviors, involvement in religious activities has been shown to be positively related to optimal health. However, it is not only those who are involved in a specific religion that benefit but so too do those identified as being spiritual.   
  
According to Greenfield et al. (2009), religiosity refers to engaging with a formal religious group's doctrines, values, traditions, and co-members. In contrast, spirituality refers to an individual's **intrapsychic sense** of connection with something transcendent (that which exists apart from and is not limited by the material universe) and the subsequent feelings of awe, gratitude, compassion, and forgiveness. Research has demonstrated a strong relationship between spirituality and psychological well-being, irrespective of an individual's religious participation (Vaillant, 2008). Additionally, Sawatzky et al. (2005) found that spirituality was related to a higher quality of life for both individuals and societies.

#### Effects

Based on reports from the 2005 National Survey of Midlife in the United States, Greenfield et al. (2009) found that higher levels of spirituality were associated with lower levels of negative effect and higher levels of positive effect, personal growth, purpose in life, positive relationships with others, self-acceptance, environmental mastery, and** autonomy.** In contrast, formal religious participation was only associated with higher levels of purpose in life and personal growth among just older adults and lower levels of autonomy. In summary, it appears that formal religious participation and spirituality relate differently to an individual's overall psychological well-being.

#### Age

Older individuals identify religion or spirituality as being more important in their lives than those younger (Beit-Hallahmi & Argyle, 1998). This age difference has been explained by several factors including that religion and spirituality assist older individuals in coping with age-related losses, provide opportunities for****socialization and social support in later life, and demonstrate a cohort effect in that older individuals were socialized more to be religious and spiritual than those younger (Greenfield et al., 2009).

#### Gender

In the United States, women report identifying as being more religious and spiritual than men (de Vaus & McAllister, 1987). According to the Pew Research Center (2016), women in the United States are more likely to say religion is very important in their lives than men (60 percent vs. 47 percent). American women also are more likely than American men to say they pray daily (64 percent vs. 47 percent) and attend religious services at least once a week (40 percent vs. 32 percent).   
  
Theories to explain this gender difference include that women may benefit more from the social-relational aspects of religion/spirituality because social relationships more strongly influence women's mental health. Additionally, women have been socialized to internalize the behaviors linked with religious values, such as cooperation and nurturance, more than males (Greenfield et al., 2009).

#### Worldwide

To measure the religious beliefs and practices of men and women around the world, the Pew Research Center (2016) conducted surveys of the general population in 84 countries between 2008 and 2015. Overall, an estimated 83 percent of women worldwide identified with a religion compared with 80 percent of men. This equaled 97 million more women than men identifying with a religion. There were no countries in which men were more religious than women by 2 percentage points or more.   
  
Among Christians, women reported higher rates of weekly church attendance and higher rates of daily prayer. In contrast, Muslim women and Muslim men showed similar levels of religiousness, except frequency of attendance at worship services. Because of religious norms, Muslim men worshiped at a mosque more often than Muslim women. Similarly, Jewish men attended a synagogue more often than Jewish women. In Orthodox Judaism, communal worship services cannot take place unless a minyan, or quorum of at least 10 Jewish men, is present, thus ensuring that men will have high rates of attendance. Only in Israel, where roughly 22 percent of all Jewish adults self-identify as Orthodox, did a higher percentage of men than women report engaging in daily prayer.

### Lesson 9: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about individuals in the category of late adulthood, not only in the United States but also across the world.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain common psychosocial development during late adulthood to the end of life.

### Late Adulthood

Late adulthood spans the mid-sixties until death. This is the longest developmental stage across the life span. Here, you will consider the growth in numbers for those in late adulthood, how that number is expected to change in the future, and the implications of this growth both to the United States and worldwide. You will also examine several theories of human aging; the physical, cognitive, and socioemotional changes that occur with this population; the vast diversity among those in this developmental stage; and ageism.

### Late Adulthood in America

Late adulthood, which includes those aged 65 years and above, is the fastest growing age division of the United States population (Gatz, Smyer, & DiGilio, 2016). Currently, one in seven Americans is 65 years of age or older. The first of the baby boomers (born from 1946–1964) turned 65 in 2011, and approximately 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day. By the year 2050, almost one in four Americans will be over 65 and will be expected to live longer than previous generations. According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2014b), a person who turned 65 in 2015 can expect to live another 19 years, which is 5.5 years longer than someone who turned 65 in 1950. This increasingly aged population has been referred to as the "graying of America." This "graying" is already having significant effects on the nation in many areas, including work, healthcare, housing, social security, caregiving, and adaptive technologies. This table shows the 2012, 2020, and 2030 projected percentages of the U.S. population ages 65 and older.

### The “Graying” of the World

Even though the United States is aging, it is still younger than most other developed countries (Ortman, Velkoff, & Hogan, 2014). Germany, Italy, and Japan all had at least 20% of their population aged 65 and over in 2012, and Japan had the highest percentage of elderly citizens. Additionally, between 2012 and 2050, the population aged 65 and over is projected to increase in all developed countries. Japan is projected to continue to have the oldest population in 2030 and 2050. Table 9.2 shows the percentages of citizens aged 65 and older in select developed countries in 2012 and projected for 2030 and 2050.

### Worldwide Age Increase

According to the National Institute on Aging (NIA, 2015b), there are 524 million people over 65 worldwide. This number is expected to increase from 8 percent to 16 percent of the global population by 2050. Between 2010 and 2050, the number of older people in less developed countries is projected to increase more than 250 percent, compared with only a 71 percent increase in developed countries.   
  
Declines in fertility and improvements in life expectancy account for the percentage increase for those 65 years and older. In more developed countries, fertility fell below the replacement rate of two live births per woman by the 1970s, down from nearly three children per woman around 1950. Fertility rates also fell in many less developed countries from an average of six children in 1950 to an average of two or three children in 2005. In 2006, fertility was at or below the two-child replacement level in 44 less developed countries (NIA, 2015d).

#### Population Studies

In total, the United States is projected to have a larger older population than other developed nations, but a smaller older population compared with China and India, the world's two most populous nations (Ortman et al., 2014). By 2050, China's older population is projected to grow larger than the total U.S. population today. As the population ages, concerns grow about who will provide for those requiring long-term care. In 2000, there were about 10 people aged 85 and older for every 100 persons between ages 50 and 64. These midlife adults are the most likely care providers for their aging parents. The number of old people requiring support from their children is expected to more than double by the year 2040 (He et al., 2005). These families will certainly need external physical, emotional, and financial support in meeting this challenge.

### Work

According to the United States Census Bureau, in 1994, approximately 12 percent of those employed were 65 and over, and by 2016, the percentage had increased to 18 percent of those employed (McEntarfer, 2019). Looking more closely at the age ranges, more than 40 percent of Americans in their 60s are still working, while 14 percent of people in their 70s and just 4 percent of those 80 and older are currently employed (Livingston, 2019). Even though they make up a smaller number of workers overall, those 65 to 74 and 75-and-older age groups are projected to have the fastest rates of growth in the next decade. 

Livingston (2019) reported that, similar to other age groups, those with higher levels of education are more likely to be employed. Approximately 37 percent of adults who are 60 and older and have a bachelor's degree or more are working. In contrast, 31 percent with some college experience and 21 percent of those with a high school diploma or less are still working at age 60 and beyond. Additionally, men 60 and older are more likely to be working than women (33 percent vs. 24 percent). 

Not only are older persons working more, but they are also earning more than previously, and their growth in earnings is greater compared to workers of other ages (McEntarfer, 2019). Older adults are proving just as capable as younger adults at the workplace. In fact, those jobs that require social skills, accumulated knowledge, and relevant experiences favor older adults (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). Older adults also demonstrate lower rates of absenteeism and greater investment in their work.

### Transitioning into Retirement

For most Americans, retirement is a process and not a one-time event (Quinn & Cahill, 2016). Sixty percent of workers transition straight to bridge jobs, which are often part-time and occur between a career and full retirement. About 15 percent of workers get another job after being fully retired. This may be due to not having adequate finances after retirement or not enjoying their retirement. Some of these jobs may be in **encore careers**, or work in a different field from the one in which they retired*.* Approximately 10 percent of workers begin phasing into retirement by reducing their hours. However, not all employers will allow this due to pension regulations.

#### Retirement Age Changes

Looking at retirement data, the average age of retirement declined from more than 70 in 1910 to age 63 in the early 1980s. Additionally, 18.5 percent of those over the age of 65 continue to work (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2012) compared with only 12 percent in 1990 (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2011). With individuals living longer once retired, the average amount of time a retired worker collects social security is approximately 17 to 18 years (James et al, 2016).

#### When to Retire

Laws often influence when someone decides to retire. In 1986, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) was amended, and mandatory retirement was eliminated for most workers (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). Pilots, air traffic controllers, federal law enforcement, national park rangers, and firefighters continue to have enforced retirement ages. Consequently, most workers can continue to work if they choose and are able to do so.   
  
Social security benefits also play a role. Those born before 1938 can receive full social security benefits at age 65. Those born between 1943 and 1954 must wait until age 66 for full benefits, and those born after 1959 must wait until age 67 (Social Security Administration, 2016). Extra months are added to those born in years between. For example, a person born in 1957 must wait until 66 years and 6 months. The longer one waits to receive social security, the more money will be paid out each month. Those retiring at age 62 receive only 75 percent of their monthly benefits, as assigned at full retirement age. Medicare health insurance is another entitlement that is not available until one is aged 65.

#### Delayed Retirement

Older adults primarily choose to delay retirement due to economic reasons (Erber & Szchman, 2015). Financially, continuing to work provides not only added income, but also means they do not need to dip into retirement savings, which may not be sufficient. Historically, there have been three parts to retirement income: social security, a pension plan, and individual savings (Quinn & Cahill, 2016).   
  
With the 2008 recession, pension plans lost value for most workers. Consequently, many older workers have had to work later in life to compensate for absent or minimal pension plans and personal savings. Social security was never intended to replace full income, and the benefits provided may not cover all the expenses, so elders continue to work. Unfortunately, many older individuals are unable to secure later employment, and those especially vulnerable include persons with disabilities, single women, the oldest old, and individuals with intermittent work histories. 

Some older adults delay retirement for psychological reasons, such as health benefits and social contacts. Recent research indicates that delaying retirement has been associated with helping one live longer. When looking at both healthy and unhealthy retirees, a one-year delay in retiring was associated with a decreased risk of death from all causes (Wu et al., 2016). When individuals are forced to retire due to health concerns or downsizing, they are more likely to have negative physical and psychological consequences (Erber & Szuchman, 2015).

#### Retirement Stages

Atchley (1994) identified several phases that individuals ago through when they retire: 

- Remote pre-retirement phase includes fantasizing about what one wants to do in retirement 
- Immediate pre-retirement phase when concrete plans are established 
- Actual retirement 
- Honeymoon phase when retirees travel and participate in activities they could not do while working 
- Disenchantment phase when retirees experience an emotional let-down 
- Reorientation phase when the retirees attempt to adjust to retirement by making less hectic plans and getting into a regular routine

Not everyone goes through every stage, but this model demonstrates that retirement is a process.

#### Post-Retirement

Those who look most forward to retirement and have plans are those who anticipate adequate income (Erber & Szuchman, 2015). This is especially true for males who have worked consistently and have a pension and/or adequate savings. Once retired, staying active and socially engaged is important. Volunteering, caregiving, and informal helping can keep seniors engaged. Kaskie et al. (2008) found that 70 percent of retirees who are not involved in productive activities spent most of their time watching TV, which is correlated with negative effects. In contrast, being productive improves well-being.

### Elder Education

Attending college is not just for the young. There are many reasons why someone in late adulthood chooses to attend college. PNC Financial Services surveyed retirees aged 70 and over and found that 58 percent had retired before they had planned (Holland, 2014). Many of these individuals chose to pursue additional training to improve skills to return to work in a second career. Others may be looking to take their career in a new direction.

For some older students who no longer focus on financial reasons, returning to school is intended to enable them to pursue work that is personally fulfilling. Attending college in late adulthood is also a great way for seniors to stay young and keep their minds sharp. Even if an elder chooses not to attend college for a degree, there are many continuing education programs on topics of interest available.

In 1975, a nonprofit educational travel organization called Elderhostel began in New Hampshire with five programs for several hundred retired participants (DiGiacomo, 2015). This program combined college classroom time with travel tours and experiential learning experiences. In 2010, the organization changed its name to Road Scholar, and it now serves 100,000 people per year in the United States and in 150 other countries. Academic courses, as well as practical skills such as computer classes, foreign languages, budgeting, and holistic medicines, are among the courses offered. Older adults who have higher levels of education are more likely to take continuing education. However, offering more educational experiences to a diverse group of older adults, including those who are institutionalized in nursing homes, can enhance the quality of life.

### Leisure

During the past ten years, leisure time for Americans 60 and older has remained at about seven hours a day. However, the amount of time spent on TVs, computers, tablets, or other electronic devices has risen almost 30 minutes per day over the past decade (Livingston, 2019). Those 60 and older now spend more than half of their daily leisure time (4 hours and 16 minutes) in front of screens.

Screen time has increased for those in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond, and across genders and education levels. This rise in screen time coincides with significant growth in the use of digital technology by older Americans. In 2000, 14 percent of those aged 65 and older used the internet, and now 73 percent are users and 53 percent own smartphones. Alternatively, the time spent on other recreational activities, such as reading or socializing, has gone down slightly. People with less education spend more of their leisure time on screens and less time reading compared with those with more education. Less-educated adults also spend less time exercising: 12 minutes a day for those with a high school diploma or less, compared with 26 minutes for college graduates.

### Lesson 10: Introduction

In this lesson, you will consider recent findings on how a young adult's socioeconomic class may affect the person's emotional life, then you will move on to consider "the big five personality traits."

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain typical emotional changes during early adulthood.

### Socioeconomic Class and Emerging Adulthood

Socioeconomic class impacts the overall functioning of a human being irrespective of class, age, and gender. It has a crucial impact on both the physical and mental well-being of an individual.

The theory of emerging adulthood was initially criticized as only reflecting upper middle-class, college-attending young adults in the United States and not those who were working class or poor (Arnett, 2016). Consequently, Arnett reviewed results from the 2012 Clark University Poll of Emerging Adults, whose participants were demographically similar to the United States population.

Results primarily indicated consistencies across aspects of the theory, including positive and negative perceptions of the time-period and views on education, work, love, sex, and marriage. Two significant differences were found, the first being that emerging adults from lower socioeconomic classes identified more negativity in their emotional lives, including higher levels of depression. Secondly, those in the lowest socioeconomic group were more likely to agree that they had not been able to find sufficient financial support to obtain the education they believed they needed. Overall, Arnett concluded that emerging adulthood exists wherever there is a period between the end of adolescence and entry into adult roles, but acknowledging social, cultural, and historical contexts was also important.

### Temperament and Personality in Adulthood

**Temperament** is defined as innate characteristics of the infant, including mood, activity level, and emotional reactivity, noticeable soon after birth. Does one's temperament remain stable throughout the life span? Do shy and inhibited babies grow up to be shy adults, while the sociable child continues to be the life of the party? Like most developmental research, the answer is more complicated than a simple yes or no.   
  
Chess and Thomas (1987), who identified children as easy, difficult, slow-to-warm-up, or blended, found that children identified as easy grew up to become well-adjusted adults, while those who exhibited a difficult temperament were not as well-adjusted as adults. Kagan (2002) studied the temperamental category of inhibition to the unfamiliar in children. Infants exposed to unfamiliarity reacted strongly to the stimuli and cried loudly, pumped their limbs, and had an increased heart rate. Research has indicated that these highly reactive children show temperamental stability into early childhood, and Bohlin and Hagekull (2009) found that shyness in infancy was linked to social anxiety in adulthood. 

An important aspect of this research on inhibition was looking at the response of the **amygdala**, which is important for fear and anxiety, especially when confronted with possible threatening events in the environment. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRIs), young adults previously identified as strongly inhibited toddlers showed heightened activation of the amygdala when compared to those who had been identified as uninhibited toddlers (Davidson & Begley, 2012). 

The research does seem to indicate that temperamental stability holds for many individuals through their life span, yet one's environment can also have a significant impact. Environmental factors are thought to change gene expression by switching genes on and off. Many cultural and environmental factors can affect one's temperament, including supportive versus abusive child-rearing, socioeconomic status, stable homes, illnesses, teratogens, etc.   
  
Additionally, individuals often choose environments that support their temperament, which in turn further strengthens them (Cain, 2012). In summary, because temperament is genetically driven, genes appear to be the major reason temperament remains stable into adulthood. In contrast, the environment appears mainly responsible for any change in temperament (Clark & Watson, 1999).

Everybody has a unique **personality**; that is, a characteristic manner of thinking, feeling, behaving, and relating to others (John et al., 2008). Personality traits refer to these characteristic, routine ways of thinking, feeling, and relating to others. Personality integrates one's temperament with cultural and environmental influences. Consequently, there are signs or indicators of these traits in childhood, but they become particularly evident when the person is an adult. Personality traits are integral to each person's sense of self, as they involve what people value, how they think and feel about things, what they like to do, and, basically, what they are like almost every day throughout much of their lives.

### Descriptions of the Big Five Traits

#### Five-Factor Model

There are hundreds of different personality traits, and all of these traits can be organized into the broad dimensions referred to as the Five-Factor Model (John, Naumann, & Soto, 2008). These five broad domains include: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (Think OCEAN to remember). This applies to traits that you may use to describe yourself.

This table summarizes the "five big traits," giving a description and some examples for each one.

#### Table S3, L10.3 Descriptions of the Big Five Traits
DimensionDescriptionExamples of behavior predicted by traits**Openness to experience**General appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, imagination, curiosity, and variety of experience.Individuals who are highly open to experience tend to have distinctive and unconventional decorations in their home. They are also likely to have books on a wide variety of topics, a diverse music collection, and works of art on display.**Conscientiousness**The tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement.Individuals who are conscientious have a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behavior.**Extraversion**The tendency to experience positive emotions and to seek stimulation and the company of others.Extroverts enjoy being with people. In groups they like to talk, assert themselves, and draw attention to themselves.**Agreeableness**The tendency to be compassionate and cooperative, rather than suspicious and antagonistic toward others; reflects individual differences in general concern for social harmony.Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are generally considerate, friendly, generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with those of others.**Neuroticism**The tendency to experience negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, or depression; sometimes called “emotional instability." Those who score high in neuroticism are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. They may have trouble thinking clearly, making decisions, and coping effectively with stress.
Adapted from John, Naumann, & Soto (2008)

### Personality Traits

#### Personality Changes Through Adulthood 

Contemporary research shows that although some people's personalities are relatively stable over time, others are not (Lucas & Donnellan, 2011; Roberts & Mroczek, 2008). Longitudinal studies reveal average changes during adulthood in the expression of some traits (for example, neuroticism and openness decrease with age and conscientiousness increases) and individual differences in these patterns due to idiosyncratic life events (such as divorce or illness).

**Longitudinal research** also suggests that adult personality traits such as conscientiousness predict important life outcomes including job success, health, and longevity (Friedman et al., 1993; Roberts et al., 2007). The Harvard Health Letter (2012) identifies research correlations between conscientiousness and lower blood pressure, lower rates of diabetes and stroke, fewer joint problems, being less likely to engage in harmful behaviors, being more likely to stick to healthy behaviors, and more likely to avoid stressful situations.

Conscientiousness also appears related to career choices, friendships, and stability of marriage. Lastly, a person possessing both self-control and organizational skills, both related to conscientiousness, may withstand the effects of aging better and have stronger cognitive skills than one who does not possess these qualities.

### Lesson 11: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about various aspects of psychosocial development in adulthood, including attachment, attachment styles, and love. 

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain how emotions influence psychosocial development during early adulthood.

### Attachment in Young Adulthood

Hazan and Shaver (1987) described the attachment styles of adults, using the same three general categories proposed by Ainsworth's research on young children: secure, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent.   
  
Hazan and Shaver developed three brief paragraphs describing the three adult attachment styles, shown in this table. Adults were then asked to think about romantic relationships they were in and select the paragraph that best described the way they felt, thought, and behaved in these relationships.

#### Table S3, L11.1 Romantic Relationships
Adult Attachment StyleDescriptionSecure I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable depending on them and having them depend on me. I don't often worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me.AvoidantI am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when anyone gets too close, and often, love partners want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being.Anxious/AmbivalentI find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesn't really love me or won't stay with me. I want to merge completely with another person, and this sometimes scares people away.
### Attachment-Related Anxiety

Bartholomew (1990) challenged the categorical view of attachment in adults and suggested that adult attachment was best described as varying along two dimensions: attachment related-anxiety and attachment-related avoidance.   
  
Attachment-related anxiety refers to the extent to which an adult worries about whether a partner really loves them. Those who score high on this dimension fear that a partner will reject or abandon them (Fraley et al., 2015).   
  
Attachment-related avoidance refers to whether an adult can open up to others and depend on others. Those who score high on attachment-related avoidance are uncomfortable with opening up and may fear that such dependency may limit their sense of **autonomy** (Fraley et al., 2015). According to Bartholomew (1990), this would yield four possible attachment styles in adults: secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and fearful-avoidant.

#### Secure and Preoccupied Styles

Securely attached adults score lower on both dimensions. They are comfortable trusting their partners and do not worry excessively about their partner's love for them. Adults with a dismissing style score low on attachment-related anxiety, but higher on attachment-related avoidance. Such adults dismiss the importance of relationships. They trust themselves but do not trust others; thus they do not share their dreams, goals, and fears with others. They do not depend on other people and feel uncomfortable when they have to do so.

Those with a preoccupied attachment are low in attachment-related avoidance, but high in attachment-related anxiety. Such adults are often prone to jealousy and worry that their partner does not love them as much as they need to be loved. Adults whose attachment style is fearful-avoidant score high on both attachment-related avoidance and attachment-related anxiety. These adults want close relationships, but do not feel comfortable getting emotionally close to others. They have trust issues with others and often do not trust their own social skills in maintaining relationships.

#### Research on attachment

Research on attachment in adulthood has found that:

- Adults with insecure attachments report lower satisfaction in their relationships (Butzer & Campbell, 2008; Holland et al., 2012). 
- Those high in attachment-related anxiety report more daily conflict in their relationships (Campbell et al., 2005).
- Those with avoidant attachment exhibit less support to their partners (Simpson et al., 2002). 
- Young adults show greater attachment-related anxiety than middle-aged or older adults (Chopik, Edelstein, & Fraley, 2013).
- Some studies report that young adults show more attachment-related avoidance (Schindler et al., 2010), while other studies find that middle-aged adults show higher avoidance than younger or older adults (Chopik et al., 2013).
- Young adults with more secure and positive relationships with their parents make the transition to adulthood more easily than those with more insecure attachments (Fraley, 2013).
- Young adults with secure attachments and authoritative parents were less likely to be depressed than those with authoritarian or permissive parents or who experienced an avoidant or ambivalent attachment (Ebrahimi et al., 2017).

### Attachment Styles

When people are asked what kinds of psychological or behavioral qualities they are seeking in a romantic partner, a large majority of people indicate that they are seeking someone who is kind, caring, trustworthy, and understanding, that is, the kinds of attributes that characterize a "secure" caregiver (Chappell & Davis, 1998).   
  
However, people do not always end up with others who meet their ideals. Are secure people more likely to end up with secure partners, and, vice versa, are insecure people more likely to end up with insecure partners? The majority of the research that has been conducted to date suggests that the answer is "yes." Frazier et al. (1996) studied the attachment patterns of more than 83 heterosexual couples and found that if the man was relatively secure, the woman was also likely to be secure.

One important question is whether these findings exist because (a) secure people are more likely to be attracted to other secure people, (b) secure people are likely to create security in their partners over time, or (c) some combination of these possibilities. Existing empirical research strongly supports the first alternative.   
  
For example, when people have the opportunity to interact with individuals who vary in security in a speed-dating context, they express a greater interest in those who are higher in security than those who are more insecure (McClure et al, 2010). However, there is also some evidence that people's attachment styles mutually shape one another in close relationships. For example, in a longitudinal study, Hudson et al. (2012) found that, if one person in a relationship experienced a change in security, their partner was likely to experience a change in the same direction.

#### Research

The majority of research on this issue is retrospective; that is, it relies on adults' reports of what they recall about their childhood experiences. This kind of work suggests that secure adults are more likely to describe their early childhood experiences with their parents as being supportive, loving, and kind (Hazan & Shaver, 1987).   
  
A number of longitudinal studies are emerging that demonstrate prospective associations between early attachment experiences and adult attachment styles and/or interpersonal functioning in adulthood. For example, Fraley et al. (2013) found in a sample of more than 700 individuals studied from infancy to adulthood that maternal sensitivity across development prospectively predicted security at age 18.   
  
Simpson, Collins, Tran, and Haydon (2007) found that attachment security, assessed in infancy in the strange situation, predicted peer competence in grades one to three, which, in turn, predicted the quality of friendship relationships at age 16, which, in turn, predicted the expression of positive and negative emotions in their adult romantic relationships at ages 20 to 23.

It is easy to come away from such findings with the mistaken assumption that early experiences "determine" later outcomes. To be clear, attachment theorists assume that the relationship between early experiences and subsequent outcomes is **probabilistic,** not deterministic. Having supportive and responsive experiences with caregivers early in life is assumed to set the stage for positive social development, but that does not mean that attachment patterns are set in stone.   
  
In short, even if an individual has far from optimal experiences in early life, attachment theory suggests that it is possible for that individual to develop well-functioning adult relationships through a number of corrective experiences, including relationships with siblings, other family members, teachers, and close friends. Security is best viewed as a culmination of a person's attachment history rather than a reflection of their early experiences alone. Those early experiences are considered important, not because they determine a person's fate, but because they provide the foundation for subsequent experiences.

### Erikson: Intimacy vs. Isolation

Erikson's (1950, 1968) sixth stage focuses on establishing intimate relationships or risking social isolation. Intimate relationships are more difficult if one is still struggling with identity. Achieving a sense of identity is a life-long process, as there are periods of identity crisis and stability.   
  
However, once identity is established, intimate relationships can be pursued. These intimate relationships include acquaintanceships and friendships, but also the more important close relationships, which are the long-term romantic relationships developed with another person in, for instance, a marriage (Hendrick & Hendrick, 2000).

#### Factors Influencing Attraction

Because most people enter into a close relationship at some point, it is useful to know what psychologists have learned about the principles of liking and loving. A major interest of psychologists is the study of **interpersonal attraction**, or what makes people like, and even love, each other.

#### Similarity

One important factor in attraction is a perceived similarity in values and beliefs between the partners (Davis & Rusbult, 2001). Similarity is important for relationships because it is more convenient if both partners like the same activities and because similarity supports one's values. We can feel better about ourselves and our choice of activities if we see that our partner also enjoys doing the same things that we do. Having others like and believe in the same things we do makes us feel validated in our beliefs. This is referred to as consensual validation and is an important aspect of why we are attracted to others.

#### Self-Disclosure

Liking is also enhanced by self-disclosure, the tendency to communicate frequently, without fear of reprisal, and in an accepting and empathetic manner. Friends are friends because we can talk to them openly about our needs and goals and because they listen and respond to our needs (Reis & Aron, 2008). However, self-disclosure must be balanced. If we open up about our concerns that are important to us, we expect our partner to do the same in return. If the self-disclosure is not reciprocal, the relationship may not last.

#### Proximity

Another important determinant of liking is **proximity**, or the extent to which people are physically near us. Research has found that we are more likely to develop friendships with people who are nearby, for instance, those who live in the same town, and even with people who just happen to sit near one another in classes (Back et al., 2008).

Proximity has its effect on liking through the principle of mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer **stimuli **(including, but not limited to people) that we have seen more frequently. The effect of mere exposure is powerful and occurs in a wide variety of situations.   
  
Infants tend to smile at a photograph of someone they have seen before more than they smile at a photograph of someone they are seeing for the first time (Brooks-Gunn & Lewis, 1981), and people prefer side-to-side reversed images of their own faces over their normal (non-reversed) face, whereas their friends prefer their normal face over the reversed one (Mita, Dermer, & Knight, 1977). This is expected on the basis of mere exposure, since people see their own faces primarily in mirrors, and thus are exposed to the reversed face more often.

#### Mere Exposure

Mere exposure may well have an evolutionary basis. We have an initial fear of the unknown, but as things become familiar, they seem more similar and safer, and thus produce more positive feelings and seem less threatening and dangerous (Harmon-Jones & Allen, 2001; Freitas et al., 2005). When the stimuli are people, there may well be an added effect. Familiar people become more likely to be seen as part of the "ingroup" rather than the "outgroup," and this may lead to liking them more. Zebrowitz and her colleagues found that people like people of our own race in part because they are perceived as similar to us (Zebrowitz et al., 2007).

### Love

Sternberg (1988) suggests that there are three main components of love: passion, intimacy, and commitment. Love relationships vary depending on the presence or absence of each of these components.  
  
Passion refers to the intense, physical attraction partners feel toward one another.   
Intimacy involves the ability to share feelings, psychological closeness, and personal thoughts with the other.   
Commitment is the conscious decision to stay together.   
  
Passion can be found in the early stages of a relationship, but intimacy takes time to develop because it is based on knowledge of the partner. Once intimacy has been established, partners may resolve to stay in the relationship. Although many would agree that all three components are important to a relationship, many love relationships do not consist of all three. Look now at other possibilities.

#### Liking

In this sort of relationship, intimacy or knowledge of the other and a sense of closeness is present. Passion and commitment, however, are not.   
  
Partners feel free to be themselves and disclose personal information. They may feel that the other person knows them well and can be honest with them and let them know if they think the person is wrong. These partners are friends. However, being told that your partner "thinks of you as a friend" can be a devastating blow if you are attracted and seeking a romantic involvement.

#### Infatuation

This is Sternberg's version of "love at first sight." Infatuation consists of an immediate, intense physical attraction to someone.   
  
A person who is infatuated finds it hard to think of anything but the other person. Brief encounters are played over and over in one's head; it may be difficult to eat and there may be a rather constant state of arousal. Infatuation is rather short-lived, however, lasting perhaps only a matter of months or as long as a year or so. It tends to be based on physical attraction and an image of what one "thinks" the other is all about.

#### Fatuous Love

However, some people who have a strong physical attraction push for commitment early in the relationship. Passion and commitment are aspects of fatuous love.   
  
There is no intimacy and the commitment is premature. Partners rarely talk seriously or share their ideas. They focus on their intense physical attraction and yet one, or both, is also talking of making a lasting commitment. Sometimes this is out of a sense of insecurity and a desire to make sure the partner is locked into the relationship.

#### Empty Love

This type of love may be found later in a relationship or in a relationship that was formed to meet needs other than intimacy or passion, including financial needs, childrearing assistance, or attaining/maintaining status.   
  
Here the partners are committed to staying in the relationship for the children, because of a religious conviction, or because there are no alternatives. However, they do not share ideas or feelings with each other and have no physical attraction for one another.

#### Romantic Love

Intimacy and passion are components of romantic love, but there is no commitment.   
  
The partners spend much time with one another and enjoy their closeness but have not made plans to continue. This may be true because they are not in a position to make such commitments or because they are looking for passion and closeness and are afraid it will die out if they commit to one another and start to focus on other kinds of obligations.

#### Companionate Love

Intimacy and commitment are the hallmarks of companionate love.   
  
Partners love and respect one another and they are committed to staying together. However, their physical attraction may have never been strong or may have just died out over time. Nevertheless, partners are good friends and committed to one another.

#### Consummate Love

Intimacy, passion, and commitment are present in consummate love.   
  
This is often perceived by western cultures as "the ideal" type of love. The couple shares passion; the spark has not died, and the closeness is there. They feel like best friends as well as lovers, and they are committed to staying together.

### Lesson 12: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about the trend for many individuals to stay single. You will also learn about the concepts of cohabitation and marriage and explore the global preference of eloping instead of getting married. This lesson also describes violence between intimate partners in all these relationships. Finally, you will learn about parenthood and the proposed influences on parenting.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain how emotions influence behavior during early adulthood.

### Singlehood

Being single is the most common lifestyle for people in their early twenties, and there has been an increase in the number of adults staying single. In 1960, only about one in 10 adults aged 25 or older had never been married; in 2012 that had risen to one in five (Wang & Parker, 2014). While just over half (53 percent) of unmarried adults say they would eventually like to get married, 32 percent are not sure, and 13 percent do not want to get married.   
  
It is projected that by the time current young adults reach their mid-forties and fifties, almost 25 percent of them may not have married. The United States is not the only country to see a rise in the number of single adults.

#### Reasons for Singlehood

Today's adults are marrying later in life, cohabitating, and raising children outside of marriage in greater numbers than in previous generations. Young adults also have other priorities, such as education and establishing their careers. This may be reflected by changes in attitudes about the importance of marriage. In a recent Pew Research survey of Americans, respondents were asked to indicate which of the following statements came closer to their own views:

- “Society is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority.”
- “Society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children.”

Slightly more adults endorsed the second statement (50 percent) than those who chose the first (46 percent), with the remainder either selecting neither, both equally, or not responding (Wang & Parker, 2014). Young adults aged 18 to 29 were more likely to endorse this view than adults aged 30 to 49 (67 percent and 53 percent respectively). In contrast, those aged 50 or older were more likely to endorse the first statement (53 percent).  
  
This table lists some of the reasons young adults give for staying single.

### Hooking Up

United States demographic changes have significantly affected the romantic relationships among emerging and early adults. The age for puberty has declined, while the average ages for first marriage and first child have been pushed higher. This results in a "historically unprecedented time gap where young adults are physiologically able to reproduce, but not psychologically or socially ready to settle down and begin a family and child rearing" (Garcia et al., 2012). Consequently, according to Bogle (2007, 2008), traditional forms of dating have shifted to more casual **hookups** that involve uncommitted sexual encounters.

Even though most research on hooking up involves college students, 70 percent of sexually active 12- to 21-year-olds reported having had uncommitted sex during the past year (Grello et al., 2003). Additionally, Manning et al. (2006) found that 61 percent of sexually active seventh, ninth, and eleventh graders reported being involved in a sexual encounter outside of a dating relationship.

#### Hooking Up Gender Differences

When asked about their motivation for hooking up, both males and females indicated physical gratification, emotional gratification, and a desire to initiate a romantic relationship as reasons (Garcia & Reiber, 2008). Although males and females are more similar than different in their sexual behaviors, a consistent finding in the research is that males demonstrate greater permissiveness to casual sex (Oliver & Hyde, 1993).   
  
In another study involving 16,288 individuals across 52 nations, males reported a greater desire of sexual partner variety than females, regardless of relationship status or sexual orientation (Schmitt et al., 2003). This difference can be attributed to gender role expectations for both males and females regarding sexual promiscuity. Additionally, the risks of sexual behavior are higher for females and include unplanned pregnancy, increased sexually transmitted diseases, and susceptibility to sexual violence (Garcia et al., 2012).

Although hooking up relationships have become normalized for emerging adults, some research indicates that the majority of both sexes would prefer a more traditional romantic relationship (Garcia et al., 2012). Owen and Fincham (2011) surveyed 500 college students with experience with hookups, and 65 percent of women and 45 percent of men reported that they hoped their hookup encounter would turn into a committed relationship. Further, 51 percent of women and 42 percent of men reported that they tried to discuss the possibility of starting a relationship with their hookup partner.   
  
Casual sex has also been reported to be the norm among gay men, but they too indicate a desire for romantic and companionate relationships (Clarke & Nichols, 1972).

#### Emotional Consequences of Hooking up

Concerns regarding hooking up behavior are certainly evident in the research literature. One significant finding is the high association of hooking up and substance use. Those engaging in **non-monogamous sex** are more likely to have used marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol, and the overall risks of sexual activity are drastically increased with the addition of alcohol and drugs (Garcia et al., 2012).   
  
Regret has also been expressed, and those who had the most regret after hooking up also had more symptoms of depression (Welsh et al., 2006). Hookups were also found to lower self-esteem, increase guilt, and foster feelings of using someone or feeling used. Females displayed more negative reactions than males, and this may be due to females identifying more emotional involvement in sexual encounters than males.

Hooking up can best be explained by a biological, psychological, and social perspective. Research indicates that emerging adults feel it is necessary to engage in hooking up behavior as part of the sexual script depicted in the culture and media. Additionally, they desire **sexual gratification**. However, they also want a more committed romantic relationship and may feel regret with uncommitted sex.

### Online Dating

The ways people are finding love have changed with the advent of the Internet. Nearly 50 million Americans have tried an online dating website or mobile app (Bryant & Sheldon, 2017). Online dating has also increased dramatically among those ages 18 to 24. Today, one in five emerging adults report using a mobile dating app, while in 2013 only 5 percent did, and 27 percent report having used online dating, almost triple the rate in 2013 (Smith & Anderson, 2016).

According to a recent survey of couples who met online versus offline (Brown, 2019), those who met online tended to have slightly different levels of education, and political views from their partners, but the biggest difference was that they were much more likely to come from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. This is not surprising as the average age of the couples who met online was 36, while the average age of couples who met offline was 51. Young adults are more likely to have a relationship with people who are different from them, regardless of how they met.

As Finkel et al. (2007) found, social networking sites and the Internet perform three important tasks. Specifically, sites provide individuals with access to a database of other individuals who are interested in meeting someone. Dating sites generally reduce issues of proximity, as individuals do not have to be close in proximity to meet. Also, they provide a medium in which individuals can communicate with others.   
  
Finally, some Internet dating websites advertise special matching strategies, based on factors such as personality, hobbies, and interests, to identify the "perfect match" for people looking for love online. Social networking sites have provided opportunities for meeting others you would not have normally met. However, social networking sites can also be forums for unsuspecting people to be duped, as the person may not be who he or she says.

#### Online Communication

Online communication differs from face-to-face interaction in a number of ways. In face-to-face meetings, people have many cues upon which to base their first impressions. A person's looks, voice, mannerisms, dress, scent, and surroundings all provide information in face-to-face meetings, but in computer-mediated meetings, written messages are the only cues provided. Fantasy is used to conjure up images of voice, physical appearance, mannerisms, and so forth.   
  
The anonymity of online involvement makes it easier to become intimate without fear of interdependence. When online, people tend to disclose more intimate details about themselves more quickly. A shy person can open up without worrying about whether or not the partner is frowning or looking away. Someone who has been abused may feel safer in virtual relationships. It is easier to tell one's secrets because there is little fear of loss. One can find a virtual partner who is warm, accepting, and undemanding (Gwinnell, 1998), and exchanges can be focused more on emotional attraction than physical appearance.

To evaluate what individuals are looking for online, Menkin et al. (2015) reviewed data from an eHarmony.com relationship questionnaire completed by a cross-sectional representation of 5,434 new users. Their results indicated that users consistently valued communication and characteristics such as personality and kindness over sexual attraction. Females valued communication over sexual attraction, even more when compared to males, and older users rated sexual attraction as less important than younger users.   
  
Alterovitz and Mendelsohn (2011) analyzed 600 Internet personal ads across the life span and found that men sought physical attractiveness and offered status-related information more than women, while women were more selective than men and sought status more than men. These findings were consistent with previous research on gender differences regarding the importance of physical or sexual attraction.

#### Catfishing

Catfishing and other forms of scamming are an increasing concern for those who use dating and social media sites and apps. Catfishing refers to a "deceptive activity involving the creation of a fake online profile for deceptive purposes" (Smith et al., 2017). You may recall that Notre Dame University linebacker Manti Ta’o fell victim to a catfishing scam. The young woman, "Kekua," who he had struck up an online relationship with was a hoax, and he was not the first person to have been scammed by this fictitious woman.   
  
A number of U.S. states have passed legislation to address online impersonation, from stealing the information and creating a fake account of a real person to the creation of a fictitious persona with the intent to defraud or harm others (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2017).

### Cohabitation

In American society, as well as in a number of other cultures, **cohabitation** has become increasingly commonplace (Gurrentz, 2018). For many emerging adults, cohabitation has become more commonplace than marriage. While marriage is still a more common living arrangement for those aged 25 to 34, cohabitation has increased, while marriage has declined. Gurrentz (2018) also found that cohabitation varies by socioeconomic status. Those who are married tend to have higher levels of education, and thus higher earnings, or earning potential.

In American society, as well as in a number of other cultures, cohabitation has become increasingly commonplace ( according to Gurrentz, 2018). For many emerging adults, cohabitation has become more commonplace than marriage. The graph shows the decline in those living with their spouses, and a steady increase in those living with partners.Lally, M., and Valentine-French, S. (2019). [Lifespan development: A psychological perspective, 2nd ed.Opens in new tab](http://dept.clcillinois.edu/psy/LifespanDevelopment.pdf) / modified from original by WGU
Copen et al. (2013) found that from 1995 to 2010, the median length of the cohabitation relationship had increased regardless of whether the relationship resulted in marriage, remained intact, or had dissolved. In 1995, the median length of the cohabitation relationship was 13 months, whereas it was 22 months by 2010.   
  
Cohabitation for all racial and ethnic groups, except for Asian women, increased between 1995 and 2010. Forty percent of cohabitations transitioned into marriage within three years, 32 percent were still cohabitating, and 27 percent of cohabitating relationships had dissolved within three years.

### Rise of Cohabitation in Western cultures

Three explanations have been given for the rise of cohabitation in Western cultures. The first notes that the increase in individualism and secularism, and the resulting decline in religious observance, has led to greater acceptance and adoption of cohabitation (Lesthaeghe & Surkyn, 1988). Moreover, the more people view cohabitating couples, the more normal this relationship becomes, resulting in more couples who will then cohabitate. Thus, cohabitation is both a cause and the effect of greater cohabitation.

A second explanation focuses on economic changes. The growth of industry and the modernization of many cultures has improved women's social status, leading to greater gender equality and sexual freedom, with marriage no longer being the only long-term relationship option (Bumpass, 1990).   
  
A final explanation suggests that the change in employment requirements, with many jobs now requiring more advanced education, has led to a competition between marriage and pursuing post-secondary education (Yu & Xie, 2015). This might account for the increase in the age of first marriage in many nations.   
  
Taken together, the greater acceptance of premarital sex and recent economic and educational changes have led to a transition in relationships. Overall, cohabitation may become a step in the courtship process or may, for some, replace marriage altogether.

Similar increases in cohabitation have also occurred in other industrialized countries. For example, rates are high in Great Britain, Australia, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. In fact, more children in Sweden are born to cohabiting couples than to married couples. The lowest rates of cohabitation in industrialized countries are in Ireland, Italy, and Japan (Benokraitis, 2005).

### Cohabitation in Non-Western Cultures, the Philippines, and China

Similar to findings in other nations, young people in the Philippines are more likely to delay marriage, to cohabitate, and to engage in premarital sex as compared to previous generations (Williams et al., 2007). Despite these changes, many young people are still not in favor of these practices.

Moreover, there is still a persistence of traditional gender norms as there are stark differences in the acceptance of sexual behavior out of **wedlock** for men and women in Philippine society. Young men are given greater freedom.

In China, young adults are cohabitating in higher numbers than in the past (Yu & Xie, 2015). Unlike many Western cultures, in China adults with higher, rather than lower, levels of education are more likely to cohabitate. Yu and Xie suggest this may be due to seeing cohabitation as being a more "innovative" behavior and that those who are more highly educated may have had more exposure to Western culture.

### Marriage Worldwide

Cohen (2013) reviewed data assessing most of the world's countries and found that marriage has declined universally during the last several decades. This decline has occurred in both poor and rich countries; however, the countries with the biggest drops in marriage were mostly rich: France, Italy, Germany, Japan, and the United States.  
  
Cohen states that the decline is not only due to individuals delaying marriage, but also because of high rates of non-marital cohabitation. Delayed or reduced marriage is associated with higher income and lower fertility rates that are reflected worldwide.

In 1960, 72 percent of adults aged 18 or older were married; in 2010 this had dropped to barely half (Wang & Taylor, 2011). At the same time, the age of first marriage has been increasing for both men and women. In 1960, the average age for first marriage was 20 for women and 23 for men. By 2021, ages had increased to 28 for women and 30 for men. Many of the explanations for increases in singlehood and cohabitation previously given can also account for the drop and delay in marriage.

### Same-Sex Marriage

On June 26, 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution guarantees same-sex marriage. The decision indicated that limiting marriage to only heterosexual couples violated the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law. This ruling occurred 11 years after same-sex marriage was first made legal in Massachusetts, and at the time of the high court decision, 36 states and the District of Columbia had legalized same-sex marriage.

### Cultural Influences on Marriage

Many cultures have both explicit and unstated rules that specify who is an appropriate mate. Consequently, mate selection is not completely left to the individual.

Rules of **endogamy** indicate the groups people should marry within and those they should not marry into (Witt, 2009). For example, many cultures specify that people marry within their own race, social class, age group, or religion. Endogamy reinforces the cohesiveness of the group.

Additionally, these rules encourage **homogamy** or marriage between people who share social characteristics. The majority of marriages in the United States are homogamous with respect to race, social class, age, and, to a lesser extent, religion. Homogamy is also seen in couples with similar personalities and interests.

#### Arranged Marriages and Elopement

Historically, marriage was not a personal choice, but one made by one's family. Arranged marriages often ensured proper transference of a family's wealth and the support of ethnic and religious customs. Such marriages were a marriage of families rather than of individuals. In Western Europe, starting in the eighteenth century, the notion of personal choice in a marital partner slowly became the norm. Arranged marriages were seen as "traditional" and marriages based on love were "modern." Many of these early love marriages were initiated by **eloping** (Thornton, 2005).

Around the world, more and more young couples are choosing their partners, even in nations where arranged marriages are still the norm such as India and Pakistan. Desai and Andrist (2010) found that only 5 percent of the women they surveyed, aged 25 to 49, had a primary role in choosing their partner. Only 22 percent knew their partner for more than one month before they were married.

However, the younger cohort of women was more likely to have been consulted by their families before their partner was chosen than were the older cohort, suggesting that family views are changing about personal choice. Allendorf (2013) reports that this 5 percent figure may also underestimate young people's choice, as only women were surveyed. Many families in India are increasingly allowing sons veto power over parents' choice of the future spouse, and some families give daughters the same say.

#### Marital Arrangements in India

As the number of arranged marriages in India is declining, elopement is increasing. Allendorf's (2013) study of a rural village in India describes the elopement process. In many cases, the female leaves her family home and goes to the male's home, where she stays with him and his parents. After a few days, a member of his family will inform her family of her whereabouts and gain consent for the marriage.

In other cases, where the couple anticipate some degree of opposition to the union, the couple may run away without the knowledge of either family, often going to a relative of the male. After a few days, the couple comes back to the home of his parents, where at that point consent is sought from both families. Although in some cases families may sever all ties with their child or encourage them to abandon the relationship, typically, they agree to the union as the couple have spent time together overnight. Once consent has been given, the couple lives with his family and is considered married. A more formal ceremony takes place a few weeks or months later.

Arranged marriages are less common in the more urban regions of India than they are outside of the cities. In rural regions, often the family farm is the young person's only means of employment. Thus, going against family choices may carry bigger consequences. Young people who live in urban centers have more employment options. As a result, they are often less economically dependent on their families and may feel freer to make their own choices.

Thornton (2005) suggests these changes are also being driven by mass media, international travel, and general Westernization of ideas. Besides India, China, Nepal, and several nations in Southeast Asia have seen a decline in the number of arranged marriages and an increase in elopement or couples choosing their own partners with their families' blessings (Allendorf, 2013).

### Predictors of Marital Harmony

Advice on how to improve one's marriage is centuries old. One of today's experts on marital communication is John Gottman. Gottman (1999) differs from many marriage counselors in his belief that having a good marriage does not depend on** compatibility**. Rather, the way that partners communicate to one another is crucial.   
  
At the University of Washington in Seattle, Gottman has measured the physiological responses of thousands of couples as they discuss issues of disagreement. Fidgeting in one's chair, leaning closer to or further away from the partner while speaking, and increases in respiration and heart rate are all recorded and analyzed along with videotaped recordings of the partners' exchanges. Gottman believes he can accurately predict whether or not a couple will stay together by analyzing their communication.   
  
In marriages destined to fail, partners engage in the "marriage killers": contempt, criticism, defensiveness, and **stonewalling**. Each of these undermines the politeness and respect that healthy marriages require. Stonewalling—shutting someone out—is the strongest sign that a relationship is destined to fail.

Gottman et al. (2000) researched the perceptions newlyweds had about their partner and marriage. The Oral History Interview used in the study looked at eight variables in marriage: fondness/affection, we-ness, expansiveness/expressiveness, negativity, disappointment, and three aspects of conflict resolution (chaos, volatility, glorifying the struggle). This interview was able to predict the stability of the marriage with 87 percent accuracy at the four- to six-year point and 81 percent accuracy at the seven- to nine-year point.   
  
Gottman (1999) developed workshops for couples to strengthen their marriages based on the results of the Oral History Interview. Interventions include increasing the positive regard for each other, strengthening their friendship, and improving communication and conflict resolution patterns.

### Accumulated Positive Deposits

A positive "balance" of relationship "deposits," like deposits in a banking account, can help a couple's overall relationship in times of conflict. For instance, some research indicates that a husband's level of enthusiasm in everyday marital interactions was related to a wife's affection in the midst of conflict (Driver & Gottman, 2004), showing that being pleasant and making "deposits" can change the nature of conflict.

Also, Gottman and Levenson (1992) found that couples rated as having more pleasant interactions, compared to couples with less pleasant interactions, reported marital problems as less severe, higher marital satisfaction, better physical health, and less risk for divorce. Finally, Janicki et al. (2006) showed that the intensity of conflict with a spouse predicted marital satisfaction, unless there was a record of positive partner interactions, in which case the conflict did not matter as much. Again, it seems as though having a positive balance through prior positive deposits helps to keep relationships strong even in the midst of conflict.

### Intimate Partner Abuse

Violence in romantic relationships is a significant concern for women in early adulthood as females aged 18 to 34 generally experience the highest rates of intimate partner violence. According to the most recent Violence Policy Center (2018) study, more than 1,800 women were murdered by men in 2016.   
  
The study found that nationwide, 93 percent of women killed by men were murdered by someone they knew, and guns were the most common weapon used. The national rate of women murdered by men in single victim-single offender incidents dropped 24 percent, from 1.57 per 100,000 in 1996 to 1.20 per 100,000 in 2016. However, since reaching a low of 1.08 per 100,000 women in 2014, the 2016 rate increased 11%.

#### Intimate Partner Violence

Intimate partner violence is often divided into **situational couple violence**, which is the violence that results when heated conflict escalates, and **intimate terrorism**, in which one partner consistently uses fear and violence to dominate the other (Bosson, et al., 2019).   
  
Men and women equally use and experience situational couple violence, while men are more likely to use intimate terrorism than are women. Consistent with this, a national survey described below found that female victims of intimate partner violence experience different patterns of violence, such as rape, severe physical violence, and stalking than male victims, who most often experienced more slapping, shoving, and pushing.

#### Results of Intimate Partner Violence

The last National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) was conducted in 2015 (Smith et al., 2018). The NISVS examines the prevalence of intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and **stalking **among women and men in the United States over the respondent's lifetime and during the 12 months before the interview. A total of 5,758 women and 4,323 men completed the survey.

Based on the results, women are disproportionately affected by intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and stalking. Results included:

- Nearly one in three women and one in six men experienced some form of contact sexual violence during their lifetime.
- Nearly one in five women and one in 39 men have been raped in their lifetime.
- Approximately one in six women and one in 10 men experienced **sexual coercion** (sexual pressure from someone in authority, or being worn down by requests for sex).
- Almost one in five women have been the victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner, while one in seven men have experienced the same.
- One in six women have been stalked during their lifetime, compared to one in 19 men.
- More than one in four women and more than one in 10 men have experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner and reported significant short- or long-term impacts, such as post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and injury.
- An estimated one in three women experienced at least one act of psychological aggression by an intimate partner during their lifetime.
- Men and women who experienced these forms of violence were more likely to report frequent headaches, chronic pain, difficulty with sleeping, activity limitations, poor physical health, and poor mental health than men and women who did not experience these forms of violence.

### Parenthood

Parenthood is undergoing changes in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Children are less likely to be living with both parents, and women in the United States have fewer children than they did previously. The average fertility rate of women in the United States was about seven children in the early 1900s and has remained relatively stable at 2.1 since the 1970s (Hamilton et al., 2011; Martinez et al., 2012).   
  
Not only are parents having fewer children, but the context of parenthood has also changed. Parenting outside of marriage has increased dramatically among most socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups, although college-educated women are substantially more likely to be married at the birth of a child than mothers with less education (Dye, 2010). People are having children at older ages, too.   
  
This is not surprising given that many of the age markers for adulthood have been delayed, including marriage, completing education, establishing oneself at work, and gaining financial independence. In 2014 the average age for American first-time mothers was 26.3 years (CDC, 2015a). The birth rate for women in their early twenties has declined in recent years, while the birth rate for women in their late thirties has risen. In 2011, 40 percent of births were to women ages 30 and older.   
  
For Canadian women, birth rates are even higher for women in their late thirties than in their early twenties. In 2011, 52 percent of births were to women ages 30 and older, and the average first-time Canadian mother was 28.5 years old (Cohn, 2013). Improved birth control methods have also enabled women to postpone motherhood. Despite the fact that young people are more often delaying childbearing, most 18- to 29-year-olds want to have children and say that being a good parent is one of the most important things in life (Wang & Taylor, 2011). 

#### Influences on Parenting

Parenting is a complex process in which parents and children influence one another. There are many reasons that parents behave the way they do. The multiple influences on parenting are still being explored. Proposed influences on parenting include: parent characteristics, child characteristics, and contextual and sociocultural characteristics. (Belsky, 1984; Demick, 1999).

#### Parent Characteristics

Parents bring unique traits and qualities to the parenting relationship that affect their decisions. These characteristics include the age of the parent, gender, beliefs, personality, developmental history, knowledge about parenting and child development, and mental and physical health. Parents' personalities affect parenting behaviors. Mothers and fathers who are more agreeable, conscientious, and outgoing are warmer and provide more structure to their children.   
  
Parents who are more agreeable, less anxious, and less negative also support their children's autonomy more than parents who are anxious and less agreeable (Prinzie et al., 2009). Parents who have these personality traits appear to be better able to respond to their children positively and provide a more consistent, structured environment for their children.

Parents' developmental histories, meaning their experiences as children, also affect their parenting strategies. Parents may learn parenting practices from their own parents. Fathers whose own parents provided monitoring, consistent and age-appropriate discipline, and warmth were more likely to provide this constructive parenting to their own children (Kerr et al., 2009).   
  
Patterns of negative parenting and ineffective discipline also appear from one generation to the next. However, parents who are dissatisfied with their own parents' approach may be more likely to change their parenting methods with their own children.

### Child Characteristics

Parenting is bidirectional. Not only do parents affect their children, children influence their parents. Child characteristics, such as gender, birth order, temperament, and health status, affect parenting behaviors and roles.   
  
For example, an infant with an easy temperament may enable parents to feel more effective, as they are easily able to soothe the child and elicit smiling and cooing. On the other hand, a cranky or fussy infant elicits fewer positive reactions from his or her parents and may result in parents feeling less effective in the parenting role (Eisenberg et al., 2008).   
  
Over time, parents of more difficult children may become more punitive and less patient with their children (Clark et al., 2000; Eisenberg et al., 1999; Kiff et al., 2011). Parents who have a fussy, difficult child are less satisfied with their marriages and have greater challenges in balancing work and family roles (Hyde et al., 2004). Thus, child temperament is one of the characteristics that influences how parents behave with their children.   
  
Another important characteristic is the gender of the child. Parents respond differently to boys and girls. Parents often assign different household chores to their sons and daughters. Girls are more often responsible for caring for younger siblings and household chores, whereas boys are more likely to be asked to perform chores outside the home, such as mowing the lawn (Grusec et al., 1996). Parents also talk differently with their sons and daughters, providing more scientific explanations to their sons and using more emotional words with their daughters (Crowley et al., 2001). 

### Contextual Factors and Sociocultural Characteristics

The parent-child relationship does not occur in isolation. Sociocultural characteristics, including economic hardship, religion, politics, neighborhoods, schools, and social support, also influence parenting. Parents who experience economic hardship are more easily frustrated, depressed, and sad, and these emotional characteristics affect their parenting skills (Conger & Conger, 2002).   
  
Culture also influences parenting behaviors in fundamental ways. Although promoting the development of skills necessary to function effectively in one's community is a universal goal of parenting, the specific skills necessary vary widely from culture to culture. Thus, parents have different goals for their children that partially depend on their culture (Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2008).   
  
Parents vary in how much they emphasize goals for independence and individual achievements, maintaining harmonious relationships, and being embedded in a strong network of social relationships. Other important contextual characteristics, such as the neighborhood, school, and social networks, also affect parenting, even though these settings do not always include both the child and the parent (Brofenbrenner, 1989).   
  
Culture is also a contributing contextual factor. For example, Latina mothers who perceived their neighborhood as more dangerous showed less warmth with their children, perhaps because of the greater stress associated with living in a threatening environment (Gonzales et al., 2011). The different influences are shown in this diagram.

### Lesson 13: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about stress in midlife, including "midlife crises," and ways of coping. 

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain typical emotional changes from middle adulthood to end of life.

### Midlife Crisis

In 1978 Daniel Levinson published a book entitled *The Seasons of a Man's Life* in which he presented a theory of development in adulthood. Levinson's work was based on in-depth interviews with 40 men between the ages of 35 to 45. Levinson (1978) indicated that adults go through stages and have an image of the future that motivates them. This image is called "the dream" and for the men interviewed, it was a dream of how their career paths would progress and where they would be at midlife.   
  
According to Levinson the midlife transition (40 to 45) was a time of reevaluating previous commitments; making dramatic changes if necessary; giving expression to previously ignored talents or aspirations; and feeling more of a sense of urgency about life and its meaning. By the time men entered middle adulthood (45 to 50), they believed they committed to the new choices made and placed their energies into these commitments.

Levinson believed that a **midlife crisis** was a normal part of development as the person is more aware of how much time has gone by and how much time is left. The future focus of early adulthood gives way to an emphasis on the present in midlife, and the men interviewed had difficulty reconciling the "dream" they held about the future with the reality they experienced. Consequently, they felt impatient and were no longer willing to postpone the things they had always wanted to do.   
  
Although Levinson believed his research demonstrated the existence of a midlife crisis, his study has been criticized for his research methods, including small sample size, similar ages, and concerns about a cohort effect. In fact, other research does not support his theory of the midlife crisis.

Vaillant (2012) believed that it was the cross-sectional design of Levinson's study that led to the erroneous conclusion of an inevitable midlife crisis. Instead, he believed that longitudinal studies of individuals' entire lives were needed to determine the factors associated with optimum health and potential. Vaillant was one of the main researchers in the 75-year-old Harvard Study of Adult Development, and he considered a midlife crisis to be a rare occurrence among the participants (Vaillant, 1977). 

Most research suggests that most people in the United States today do not experience a midlife crisis. Results of a 10-year study conducted by the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful Midlife Development, based on telephone interviews with over 3,000 midlife adults, suggest that the years between 40 and 60 are ones marked by a sense of well-being. Only 23 percent of their participants reported experiencing a midlife crisis. The crisis tended to occur among the highly educated and was triggered by a major life event rather than out of a fear of aging (Research Network on Successful Midlife Development, 2007).

### Stress

Stress plays a major role in mental and physical health, but what exactly is stress? The term *stress* is defined as a pattern of physical and psychological responses in an organism after it perceives a threatening event that disturbs its homeostasis and taxes its abilities to cope with the event (Hooker & Pressman, 2016).   
  
Stress was originally derived from the field of mechanics where it is used to describe materials under pressure. The word was first used in a psychological manner by researcher Hans Selye, who was examining the effect of an ovarian hormone that he thought caused sickness in a sample of rats. Surprisingly, he noticed that almost any injected hormone produced this same sickness. He realized that it was not the hormone under investigation that was causing these problems, but instead, the aversive experience of being handled and injected by researchers led to high physiological arousal and eventually to health problems like ulcers.

### General Adaptation Syndrome

Selye (1946) coined the term ***stressor*** to label a stimulus that had a stressful effect on the body. He developed a model of the stress response called the General Adaptation Syndrome, which is a three-phase model of stress that includes a mobilization of physiological resources phase, a coping phase, and an exhaustion phase (when an organism fails to cope with the stress adequately and depletes its resources). This graph illustrates the General Adaptation Syndrome.

Researcher Hans Selye, coined the term "stressor" to label a stimulus that had this effect on the body (causing stress). He developed a model of the stress response called the General Adaptation Syndrome, which is a three-phase model of stress, which includes an Alarm Reaction stage of mobilization of physiological resources, a Resistance or coping stage, and finally an exhaustion stage (i.e., when an organism fails to cope with the stress adequately and depletes its resources).Lally, M., and Valentine-French, S. (2019). [Lifespan development: A psychological perspective, 2nd ed.Opens in new tab](http://dept.clcillinois.edu/psy/LifespanDevelopment.pdf) / modified from original by WGU
Psychologists have studied stress in a myriad of ways, and it is not just a major **life stressor** (a family death, a natural disaster, or similar) that increases the likelihood of getting sick. Stress can result from negative events, chronically difficult situations, a biological fight-or-flight response, and as clinical illness, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).   
  
Even small daily hassles, like getting stuck in traffic or fighting with a friend, can raise blood pressure, alter stress hormones, and even suppress the immune system function (DeLongis et al., 1988; Twisk et al., 1999). Stress continues to be one of the most important and well-studied psychological correlates of illness because excessive stress causes potentially damaging wear and tear on the body and can influence almost any disease process.

### Stress Management

On a scale from one to 10, Americans aged 39 to 52 rated their stress at 5.3, and those aged 53 to 71 rated their stress at 3.9 (American Psychological Association, 2017). The most common sources of stress included the future of the nation, money, work, current political climate, and violence and crime.

Given that these sources of stress are often difficult to change, a number of interventions have been designed to help reduce the aversive responses to duress, especially related to health. For example, relaxation activities and forms of meditation are techniques that allow individuals to reduce their stress via breathing exercises, muscle relaxation, and mental imagery.

Physiological arousal from stress can also be reduced via biofeedback, a technique where the individual is shown bodily information that is not normally available to them (for example, heart rate), and then taught strategies to alter this signal. This type of intervention has even shown promise in reducing heart and hypertension risk, as well as other serious conditions (Moravec, 2008; Patel et al., 1981). Reducing stress does not have to be complicated. For example, exercise is a great stress reduction activity (Salmon, 2001) that has a myriad of health benefits.

### Coping Strategies

Coping is often classified into two categories: **problem-focused coping** and **emotion-focused coping** (Carver et al., 1989).   
  
Problem-focused coping is thought of as actively addressing the event that is causing stress in an effort to solve the issue at hand. For example, say you have an important exam coming up next week. A problem-focused strategy might be to spend additional time over the weekend studying to make sure you understand all of the material.   
  
Emotion-focused coping, on the other hand, regulates the emotions that come with stress. In the above examination example, this might mean watching a funny movie to take your mind off the anxiety you are feeling. In the short term, emotion-focused coping might reduce feelings of stress, but problem-focused coping seems to have the greatest impact on mental wellness (Billings & Moos, 1981; Herman-Stabl et al., 1995).   
  
That being said, when events are uncontrollable (for instance, the death of a loved one), emotion-focused coping directed at managing feelings might, at first, be the better strategy. Therefore, it is always important to consider the match of the stressor to the coping strategy when evaluating its potential benefits.

### Lesson 14: Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about the emotional and psychosocial development of an individual from middle to late adulthood, with an emphasis on the latter.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain how emotions influence psychosocial development from middle adulthood to end of life.

### Erikson: Integrity vs. Despair

How do people cope with old age? According to Erikson, the last psychosocial stage is Integrity vs. Despair. This stage includes “a retrospective accounting of one’s life to date; how much one embraces life as having been well lived, as opposed to regretting missed opportunities” (Erikson, 1982).

Those in late adulthood need to achieve both the acceptance of their life and the inevitability of their death (Barker, 2016). This stage includes finding meaning in one’s life and accepting one’s accomplishments, but also acknowledging what in life has not gone as hoped. It is also feeling a sense of contentment and accepting others’ deficiencies, including those of their parents. This acceptance will lead to integrity, but if elders are unable to achieve this acceptance, they may experience despair. Bitterness and resentments in relationships and life events can lead one to despair at the end of life. According to Erikson (1982), successful completion of this stage leads to wisdom in late life. 

Erikson’s theory was the first to propose a life span approach to development, and it has encouraged the belief that older adults still have developmental needs. Prior to Erikson’s theory, older adulthood was seen as a time of social and leisure restrictions and a focus primarily on physical needs (Barker, 2016). The current focus on aging well by keeping healthy and active helps to promote integrity. There are many avenues for those in late adulthood to remain vital members of society.

### Staying Active

Many older adults want to remain active and work toward replacing opportunities lost with new ones. Those who prefer to keep themselves busy demonstrate the **activity theory,** which states that greater satisfaction with one’s life occurs with those who remain active (Lemon et al., 1972).   
  
Not surprisingly, more positive views on aging and greater health are noted with those who keep active than those who isolate themselves and disengage with others. Community, faith-based, and volunteer organizations can all provide those in late adulthood with opportunities to remain active and maintain social networks. Erikson’s concept of **generativity** applies to many older adults, just as it did in midlife.

### Generativity in Late Adulthood

Research suggests that generativity is not a concern just for midlife adults, but also for many elders into late adulthood. More and more, older adults contribute by continuing to work beyond age 65, volunteering in their community, and raising their grandchildren. 

#### Volunteering

Many older adults spend time volunteering. Hooyman and Kiyak (2011) found that religious organizations are the primary settings for encouraging and providing opportunities to volunteer. Hospitals and environmental groups also provide volunteer opportunities for older adults.

While volunteering peaks in middle adulthood, it continues to remain high among adults in their sixties, with about 40 percent engaging in volunteerism (Hooyman & Kiyak, 2011). While the number of older adults volunteering their time does decline with age, the number of hours older adults volunteer does not show much decline until they are in their late seventies (Hendricks & Cutler, 2004). African American older adults volunteer at higher levels than other ethnic groups (Taylor et al., 2004). Taylor and colleagues attribute this to the higher involvement in religious organizations by older African Americans. 

Volunteering aids older adults as much as it does the community at large. Older adults who volunteer experience more social contact, which has been linked to higher rates of life satisfaction, and lower rates of depression and anxiety (Pilkington et al., 2012). Longitudinal research also finds a strong link between health in later adulthood and volunteering (Kahana et al., 2013).

Lee et al. (2011) found that even among the oldest-old, the death rate of those who volunteer is half that of non-volunteers. However, older adults who volunteer may already be healthier, which is why they can volunteer compared to their less healthy age mates. New opportunities exist for older adults to serve as virtual volunteers by dialoguing online with others from around the world and sharing their support, interests, and expertise.

These volunteer opportunities range from helping teens with their writing to communicating with "neighbors" in villages of developing countries. Virtual volunteering is available to those who cannot engage in face-to-face interactions, and it opens up a new world of possibilities and ways to connect, maintain identity, and be productive.

### Grandparents Raising Grandchildren

According to the 2014 American Community Survey (U.S. Census, 2014a), over 5.5 million children under the age of 18 were living in families headed by a grandparent. This was more than a half a million increase from 2010. While most grandparents raising grandchildren are between the ages of 55 and 64, approximately 25 percent of grandparents raising their grandchildren are 65 and older (Office on Women’s Health, 2010a).   
  
For many grandparents, parenting a second time can be harder. Older adults have far less energy, and often the reason why they are now acting as parents to their grandchildren is because of traumatic events. A survey by AARP (Goyer, 2010) found that grandparents were raising their grandchildren because the parents had problems with drugs and alcohol, had a mental illness, were incarcerated, had divorced, had a chronic illness, were homeless, had neglected or abused the child, were deployed in the military, or had died.   
  
While most grandparents state they gain great joy from raising their grandchildren, they also face greater financial, health, education, and housing challenges that often derail their retirement plans than do grandparents who do not have primary responsibility for raising their grandchildren.

### Late Adult Lifestyles

### Marriage

As can be seen in the image below, the most common living arrangement for older adults in 2015 was marriage (Administration on Aging, 2017 ), even more so for older men.
[Opens in new tab](https://assets.wgu.edu/2e34aad59174162cd99f6d642f762dec)Image description
The most common living arrangement for older adults in 2015 was marriage (AOA, 2017). Although this was more common for older men (70 percent) compared to older women (46 percent).Lally, M., and Valentine-French, S. (2019). [Lifespan development: A psychological perspective, 2nd ed.Opens in new tab](http://dept.clcillinois.edu/psy/LifespanDevelopment.pdf) / modified from original by WGU
### Widowhood

Losing one’s spouse is one of the most difficult transitions in life. The Social Readjustment Rating Scale, commonly known as the Holmes-Rahe Stress Inventory, rates the death of a spouse as the most significant stressor (Holmes & Rahe, 1967).   
  
The loss of a spouse after many years of marriage may make an older adult feel adrift in life. They must remake their identity after years of seeing themselves as a husband or wife. Approximately one in three women aged 65 and older are widowed, compared with about one in ten men.   
  
Loneliness is the biggest challenge for those who have lost their spouse (Kowalski & Bondmass, 2008). However, several factors can influence how well someone adjusts to this event. Older adults who are more extroverted (McCrae & Costa, 1988) and have higher self-efficacy (Carr, 2004b) often fare better. Positive support from adult children is also associated with fewer symptoms of depression and better adjustment in the months following widowhood (Ha, 2010). 

The context of the death is also an important factor in how people may react to the death of a spouse. The stress of caring for an ill spouse can result in a mixed blessing when the ill partner dies (Erber & Szchman, 2015). The death of a spouse who died after a lengthy illness may come as a relief for the surviving spouse, who may have had the pressure of providing care for someone who was increasingly less able to care for themselves. At the same time, this sense of relief may be intermingled with guilt for feeling relief at the passing of their spouse. The emotional issues of grief are complex.

Widowhood also poses health risks. The **widowhood mortality effect** refers to the higher risk of death after the death of a spouse (Sullivan & Fenelon, 2014). Subramanian et al. (2008) found that widowhood increases the risk of dying from almost all causes. However, research suggests that the predictability of the spouse’s death plays an important role in the relationship between widowhood and mortality.   
  
Elwert and Christakis (2008) found that the rate of mortality for widows and widowers was lower if they had time to prepare for the death of their spouse, such as in the case of a terminal illness like Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s. Another factor that influences the risk of mortality is gender. Men show a higher risk of mortality following the death of their spouse if they have higher health problems (Bennett et al., 2005). In addition, widowers have a higher risk of suicide than do widows (Ruckenhauser et al., 2007).

### Divorce

Older adults are divorcing at higher rates than in prior generations. However, adults aged 65 and over are still less likely to divorce than middle-aged and young adults (Wu & Schimmele, 2007). Divorce poses a number of challenges for older adults, especially women, who are more likely to experience financial difficulties and are more likely to remain single than are older men (McDonald & Robb, 2004).   
  
However, in both America (Lin, 2008) and England (Glaser et al., 2008) studies have found that the adult children of divorced parents offer more support and care to their mothers than their fathers. While divorced, older men may be better off financially and are more likely to find another partner, they may receive less support from their adult children.

### Dating and Remarriage and Cohabitation

#### Dating

Due to changing social norms and shifting cohort demographics, it has become more common for single older adults to be involved in dating and romantic relationships (Alterovitz & Mendelsohn, 2011). An analysis of widows and widowers ages 65 and older found that 18 months after the death of a spouse, 37 percent of men and 15 percent of women were interested in dating (Carr, 2004a).

Unfortunately, opportunities to develop close relationships often diminish in later life as social networks decrease because of retirement, relocation, and the death of friends and loved ones (de Vries, 1996). Consequently, older adults, much like those younger, are increasing their social networks using technologies, including e-mail, chat rooms, and online dating sites (Fox, 2004; Wright & Query, 2004; Papernow, 2018). 

Interestingly, older men and women parallel online dating information as those younger. Alterovitz and Mendelsohn (2011) analyzed 600 internet personal ads from different age groups, and across the life span, men sought physical attractiveness and offered status-related information more than women. With advanced age, men desired women increasingly younger than themselves, whereas women desired older men until ages 75 and over when they sought men younger than themselves.

Research has previously shown that older women in romantic relationships are not interested in becoming a caregiver or becoming widowed for a second time (Carr, 2004a). Additionally, older men are more eager to repartner than are older women (Davidson, 2001; Erber & Szuchman, 2015). Concerns expressed by older women included not wanting to lose their autonomy, care for a potentially ill partner, or merge their finances with someone (Watson & Stelle, 2011). 

Older dating adults also need to know about threats to sexual health, including being at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamydia, genital herpes, and HIV. Nearly 25 percent of people living with HIV-AIDS in the United States are 50 or older (Office on Women’s Health, 2010b). Githens and Abramsohn (2010) found that only 25 percent of adults 50 and over who were single or had a new sexual partner used a condom the last time they had sex. Robin (2010) stated that 40 percent of those 50 and over have never been tested for HIV. These results indicated that educating all individuals, not just adolescents, on healthy sexual behavior is important.

#### Remarriage and Cohabitation

Older adults who remarry often find that their remarriages are more stable than those of younger adults. Kemp and Kemp (2002) suggest that greater emotional maturity may lead to more realistic expectations regarding marital relationships, leading to greater stability in remarriages in later life. Older adults are also more likely to be seeking companionship in their romantic relationships.

Carr (2004a) found that older adults who have considerable emotional support from their friends were less likely to seek romantic relationships. In addition, older adults who have divorced often desire the companionship of intimate relationships without marriage. As a result, cohabitation is increasing among older adults, and like remarriage, cohabitation in later adulthood is often associated with more positive consequences than it is in younger age groups (King & Scott, 2005).

No longer being interested in raising children, and perhaps wishing to protect family wealth, older adults may see cohabitation as a good alternative to marriage. In 2014, 2 percent of adults age 65 and up were cohabitating (Stepler, 2016a).

#### Living Apart Together

In addition to cohabiting there has been an increase in **living apart together** (LAT), which is “a monogamous intimate partnership between unmarried individuals who live in separate homes but identify themselves as a committed couple” (Benson & Coleman, 2016, p. 797). This trend has been found in several nations and is motivated by: 

- A strong desire to be independent in day-to-day decisions 
- Maintaining their own home 
- Keeping boundaries around established relationships 
- Maintaining financial stability

Besides the desire to be autonomous, there is also a need for companionship, sexual intimacy, and emotional support. According to Bensen and Coleman, there are differences in LAT among older and younger adults. Those who are younger often enter into LAT out of circumstances, such as the job market, and they frequently view this arrangement as a transitional stage.

In contrast, 80 percent of older adults reported that they did not wish to cohabitate or marry. For some, it was a conscious choice to live more independently. For instance, older women desired the LAT lifestyle as a way of avoiding the traditional gender roles that are often inherent in relationships where the couple lives together. However, some older adults become LATs because they fear social disapproval from others if they were to live together.

Overview

Read this to learn how care for older gay and lesbian adults can differ from that offered heterosexual elders.

### Gay and Lesbian Elders

Approximately three million older adults in the United States identify as lesbian or gay (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014). By 2025, that number is expected to rise to more than seven million (National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 2006). Despite the increase in numbers, older lesbian and gay adults are one of the least researched demographic groups, and the research there is portrays a population faced with discrimination.   
  
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2011), compared to heterosexuals, lesbian and gay adults experience both physical and mental health differences. More than 40 percent of lesbian and gay adults ages 50 and over suffer from at least one chronic illness or disability and compared to heterosexuals they are more likely to smoke and binge drink (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014).   
  
Additionally, gay older adults have an increased risk of prostate cancer (Blank, 2005) and infection from HIV and other sexually transmitted illnesses (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008). When compared to heterosexuals, lesbian and gay elders have less support from others as they are twice as likely to live alone and four times less likely to have adult children (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014).

Lesbian and gay older adults who belong to ethnic and cultural minorities, conservative religions, and rural communities may face additional stressors. Ageism, heterocentrism, sexism, and racism can combine cumulatively and impact the older adult beyond the negative impact of each individual form of discrimination (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014). David and Knight (2008) found that older gay black men reported higher rates of racism than younger gay black men and higher levels of perceived ageism than older gay white men. 

#### LGBT Elder Care

Approximately seven million LGBT people over age 50 will reside in the United States by 2030, and 4.7 million of them will need elder care. Decisions regarding elder care is often left for families, and because many LGBT people are estranged from their families, they are left in a vulnerable position when seeking living arrangements (Alleccia & Bailey, 2019). A  history of discriminatory policies, such as housing being restricted to married individuals involving one man and one woman, and stigma associated with LGBT people make them especially vulnerable to negative housing experiences when looking for elder care.

Although lesbian and gay older adults face many challenges, more than 80 percent indicate that they engage in some form of wellness or spiritual activity (Fredrickson-Goldsen et al., 2011). They also gather social support from friends and “family members by choice” rather than legal or biological relatives (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014). This broader social network provides extra support to gay and lesbian elders.

An important consideration when reviewing the development of gay and lesbian older adults is the cohort in which they grew up (Hillman & Hinrichsen, 2014). The oldest lesbian and gay adults came of age in the 1950s when there were no laws to protect them from victimization. The baby boomers, who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s, began to see states repeal laws that criminalized homosexual behavior.   
  
Future lesbian and gay elders will have different experiences due to the legal right for same-sex marriage and greater societal acceptance. Consequently, just like all those in late adulthood, understanding that gay and lesbian elders are a heterogeneous population is important when understanding their overall development.

### Successful Aging 

Although definitions of **successful aging** are value-laden, Rowe and Kahn (1997) defined three criteria of successful aging that are useful for research and behavioral interventions. They include: 

- Relative avoidance of disease, disability, and risk factors, like high blood pressure, smoking, or obesity
- Maintenance of high physical and cognitive functioning 
- Active engagement in social and productive activities 

For example, research has demonstrated that age-related declines in cognitive functioning across the adult life span may be slowed through physical exercise and lifestyle interventions (Kramer & Erickson, 2007).   
  
Another way that older adults can respond to the challenges of aging is through compensation. Specifically, **selective optimization with compensation** is used when the elder makes adjustments, as needed, in order to continue living as independently and actively as possible (Baltes & Dickson, 2001).   
  
When older adults lose functioning, referred to as loss-based selection, they may first use new resources/technologies or continually practice tasks to maintain their skills. However, when tasks become too difficult, they may compensate by choosing other ways to achieve their goals. For example, a person who can no longer drive needs to find alternative transportation, or a person who is compensating for having less energy learns how to reorganize the daily routine to avoid overexertion.

### Lesson 15: Introduction

The impact of death or the thought of impending death can be harsh. In this lesson, you will learn about how physical death takes place today and what the term *social death* means.

### Learning Objective

Consider the following learning objective as you move through the lesson:

- Explain how emotions influence behavior from early adulthood to end of life.

### Death Defined 

One way to understand death and dying is to look more closely at its definition. According to the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) (Uniform Law Commissioners, 1980), a person's death is explained this way:

An individual who has sustained either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, is dead. A determination of death must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards.  

The UDDA was approved for the United States in 1980 by a committee of national commissioners, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and the President’s Commission on Medical Ethics. This act has since been adopted by most states and provides a comprehensive and medically factual basis for determining death in all situations.

#### Death Process

For those individuals who are terminal and for whom death is expected, a series of physical changes occur. Bell (2010) identifies some of the major changes that occur over weeks, days, and hours leading up to death:

#### Weeks Before Passing 

- Minimal appetite; prefers easily digested foods 
- Increase in the need for sleep 
- Increased weakness 
- Incontinence of bladder and/or bowel 
- Restlessness or disorientation 
- Increased need for assistance with care 

#### Days Before Passing 

- Decreased level of consciousness 
- Pauses in breathing 
- Decreased blood pressure 
- Decreased urine volume and urine color darkens 
- Murmuring to people others cannot see 
- Reaching in air or picking at covers 
- Need for assistance with all care 

#### Days to Hours Before Passing 

- Decreased level of consciousness or comatose-like state 
- Inability to swallow 
- Pauses in breathing become longer 
- Shallow breaths 
- Weak or absent pulse 
- Knees, feet, and/or hands becoming cool or cold 
- Knees, feet, and/or hand discoloration to purplish hue 
- Noisy breathing due to relaxed throat muscles, often called a “death rattle” 
- Skin coloring becoming pale, waxen

#### **Social Death**

**Social death** is a completely different phenomenon and begins much earlier than physical death (Pattison, 1977). Social death occurs when others begin to dehumanize and withdraw from someone who is terminally ill or has been diagnosed with a terminal illness (Glaser & Strauss, 1966). Dehumanization includes ignoring them, talking about them if they were not present, making decisions without consulting them first, and forcing unwanted procedures.

Sweeting and Gilhooly (1997) further identified older people in general, and people with a loss of personhood, as having the characteristics necessary to be treated as socially dead. More recently, the concept has been used to describe the exclusion of people with HIV-AIDS, younger people living with a terminal illness, and the preference to die at home (Brannelly, 2011).   
  
Those diagnosed with conditions such as AIDS or cancer may find that friends, family members, and even healthcare professionals begin to say less and visit less frequently. Meaningful discussions may be replaced with comments about the weather or other topics of light conversation. Doctors may spend less time with patients after their prognosis becomes poor. 

Why do others begin to withdraw? Friends and family members may feel that they do not know what to say or that they can offer no solutions to relieve suffering. They withdraw to protect themselves against feeling inadequate or from having to face the reality of death.   
  
Health professionals, trained to heal, may also feel inadequate and uncomfortable facing decline and death. People in nursing homes may live as socially dead for years with no one visiting or calling. Social support is important for the quality of life, and those who experience social death are deprived from the benefits that come from loving interaction with others (Bell, 2010). 

Why would younger or healthier people dehumanize those who are incapacitated, older, or unwell? One explanation is that dehumanization is the result of the healthier person placing a protective distance between themselves and the incapacitated, older, or unwell person (Brannelly, 2011). This keeps the well person from thinking of themselves as becoming ill or in need of assistance.   
  
Another explanation is the repeated experience of loss that paid caregivers experience when working with terminally ill and older people requires a distance that protects against continual grief and sadness, and possibly even burnout.

### Most Common Causes of Death

The most recent statistics analyzed by the World Health Organization were in 2016 (WHO, 2018) and non-communicable deaths—that is, those not passed from person-to-person—were responsible for the majority of deaths. The three most common non-communicable diseases were heart disease, stroke, and COPD. Tobacco use is attributed as one of the top killers and is often the hidden cause behind many of the diseases that result in death, such as heart disease and chronic lung diseases.

#### Statistics

These statistics hide the differences in the causes of death among high versus low-income nations. In high-income countries, defined as having a per capita annual income of $12,476 or more, 70 percent of deaths are among people aged 70 and older. Only 1 percent of deaths occur in children under 15 years of age. People predominantly die of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancers, dementia, or diabetes. Lower respiratory infections remain the only leading infectious cause of death in such nations.   
  
In contrast, in low-income countries, defined as having a per capita annual income of $1025 or less, almost 40 percent of deaths are among children under age 15, and only 20 percent of deaths are among people aged 70 years and older. People predominantly die of infectious diseases such as lower respiratory infections, HIV-AIDS, diarrheal diseases, malaria, and tuberculosis. These account for almost one-third of all deaths in these countries. Complications of childbirth due to prematurity, birth asphyxia, and birth trauma are among the leading causes of death for newborns and infants in the poorest of nations (WHO, 2018). 

#### The United States

In 1900 in the United States, the most common causes of death were infectious diseases, which brought death quickly. Today, the most common causes of death are chronic diseases in which a slow and steady decline in health ultimately results in death. In 2016, heart disease, cancer, and accidents were the leading causes of death.

#### Causes of Death by Age

The causes of death vary by age. Prior to age one, SIDS, congenital problems, and other birth complications are the largest contributors to infant mortality. Accidents, known as unintentional injuries, become the leading cause of death throughout childhood and into middle adulthood. In later middle adulthood and late adulthood heart disease, cancer, and other medical conditions become the leading killers.

### Where Do People Die?

Gathering statistics on the location of death is not a simple matter. Those with terminal illnesses may be going through the process of dying at home or in a nursing home, only to be transported to a hospital in the final hours of their life. According to the Stanford School of Medicine (2019), most Americans (80 percent) would prefer to die at home, however: 

- 60 percent of Americans die in acute care hospitals 
- 20 percent in nursing homes 
- 20 percent at home

While dying at home is not favored in certain cultures, and some patients may prefer to die in a hospital, the results indicate that fewer people are dying at home. Internationally, 54 percent of deaths in over 45 nations occurred in hospitals, with the most frequently occurring in Japan (78 percent) and the least frequently occurring in China (20 percent), according to a study by Broad et al. (2013).   
  
Broad et al. (2013) also found that for older adults, 18 percent of deaths occurred in some form of residential care, such as nursing homes, and that for each decade after age 65, the rate of dying in such settings increased 10 percent. In addition, the number of women dying in residential care was considerably higher than the number of men.

### Developmental Perceptions of Death and Death Anxiety

The concept of death changes from early childhood to late adulthood. Cognitive development, societal beliefs, familial responsibilities, and personal experiences all shape an individual’s view of death (Batts, 2004; Erber & Szuchman, 2015; National Cancer Institute, 2013). 

#### Infancy

Certainly, infants do not comprehend death; however, they do react to the separation caused by death. Infants separated from their mothers may become sluggish and quiet, no longer smile or coo, sleep less, and develop physical symptoms such as weight loss. 

#### Early Childhood

As you recall from Piaget’s preoperational stage of cognitive development, young children experience difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy. It is therefore not surprising that young children lack an understanding of death.

They do not see death as permanent, assume it is temporary or reversible, think the person is sleeping, and believe they can wish the person back to life. Additionally, they feel they may have caused the death through their actions, such as misbehavior, words, and feelings. 

#### Middle Childhood

Although children in middle childhood begin to understand the finality of death, up until the age of nine they may still participate in magical thinking and believe that through their thoughts they can bring someone back to life. They also may think that they could have prevented the death in some way, and consequently feel guilty and responsible for the death. 

#### Late Childhood

At this stage, children understand the finality of death and know that everyone will die, including themselves. However, they may also think people die because of some wrongdoing on the part of the deceased. They may develop fears of their parents dying and continue to feel guilty if a loved one dies. 

#### Adolescence

Adolescents understand death as well as adults. With formal operational thinking, adolescents can now think abstractly about death, philosophize about it, and ponder their own lack of existence. Some adolescents become fascinated with death and reflect on their own funerals by fantasizing how others will feel and react.

Despite a preoccupation with thoughts of death, the personal fable of adolescence causes them to feel immune to death. Consequently, they often engage in risky behaviors, such as substance use, unsafe sexual behavior, and reckless driving, thinking they are invincible.

#### Early Adulthood

In adulthood, there are differences in the level of fear and anxiety concerning death experienced by those in different age groups. For those in early adulthood, their overall lower rate of death is a significant factor in their lower rates of death anxiety. Individuals in early adulthood typically expect a long life ahead of them and consequently do not think or worry about death. 

#### Middle Adulthood

Those in middle adulthood report more fear of death than those either in their early or late adulthood. The caretaking responsibilities for those in middle adulthood are a significant factor in their fears. As mentioned previously, middle adults often provide assistance for both their children and parents, and they feel anxious about leaving them to care for themselves. 

#### Late Adulthood

Contrary to the belief that because they are so close to death, they must fear death, those in late adulthood have lower fears of death than other adults. Why would this occur?

First, older adults have fewer caregiving responsibilities and are not worried about leaving family members on their own. They also have had more time to complete activities they had planned in their lives, and they realize that the future will not provide as many opportunities for them.

Additionally, they have less anxiety because they have already experienced the death of loved ones and have become accustomed to the likelihood of death. It is not death itself that concerns those in late adulthood; rather, it is having control over how they die.

### Curative, Palliative, and Hospice Care

When individuals become ill, they need to make choices about the treatment they wish to receive. One’s age, the type of illness, and one's personal beliefs about dying all affect the type of treatment chosen (Bell, 2010). 

**Curative care** is designed to overcome and cure disease and illness (Fox, 1997). Its aim is to promote complete recovery, not just to reduce symptoms or pain. An example of curative care would be chemotherapy.   
  
While curing illness and disease is an important goal of medicine, it is not its only goal. As a result, some have criticized the curative model as ignoring the other goals of medicine, including preventing illness, restoring functional capacity, relieving suffering, and caring for those who cannot be cured. 

**Palliative care** focuses on providing comfort and relief from physical and emotional pain to patients throughout their illness, even while being treated (NIH, 2007). In the past, palliative care was confined to offering comfort for the dying. Now it is offered whenever patients suffer from chronic illnesses, such as cancer or heart disease (IOM, 2015). Palliative care is also part of hospice programs. 

Hospice emerged in the United Kingdom in the mid-twentieth century as a result of the work of Cicely Saunders. This approach became popularized in the United States by the work of Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (IOM, 2015), and by 2012 there were 5,500 hospice programs in the country (National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO), 2013). 

**Hospice care**—whether at home, in a hospital, nursing home, or hospice facility—involves a team of professionals and volunteers who provide terminally ill patients with medical, psychological, and spiritual support, along with support for their families (Shannon, 2006). The aim of hospice is to help the dying be as free from pain as possible and to comfort both the patients and their families during a difficult time.

### Hospice Care

**Hospice care**—whether at home, in a hospital, nursing home, or hospice facility—involves a team of professionals and volunteers who provide terminally ill patients with medical, psychological, and spiritual support, along with support for their families (Shannon, 2006). The aim of hospice is to help the dying be as free from pain as possible and to comfort both the patients and their families during a difficult time.

In order to enter hospice, a patient must be diagnosed as terminally ill with an anticipated death within six months (IOM, 2015). The patient is allowed to go through the dying process without invasive treatments. Hospice workers try to inform the family what to expect and reassure them that much of what they see is a normal part of the dying process.  

#### Types of Hospice

According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (2019), there are four types of hospice care in America: 

- Routine hospice care, where the patient has chosen to receive hospice care at home, is the most common form of hospice. 
- Continuous home care is predominantly nursing care, with caregiver and hospice aides supplementing this care to manage pain and acute symptom crises for 8 to 24 hours in the home. 
- Inpatient respite care is provided by a hospital, hospice, or long-term care facility to provide temporary relief for family caregivers. 
- General inpatient care is provided by a hospital, hospice, or long-term care facility when pain and acute symptom management can not be handled in other settings. 

In 2017, an estimated 1.5 million people residing in America received hospice care (NHPCO, 2019). The majority of patients on hospice were patients suffering from dementia, heart disease, or cancer, and typically did not enter hospice until the last few weeks prior to death. Almost one out of three patients were on hospice for less than a week.

#### Basic Elements

According to Shannon (2006), the basic elements of hospice include: 

- Care of the patient and family as a single unit 
- Pain and symptom management for the patient 
- Having access to both daytime and nighttime care 
- Coordination of all medical services 
- Social work, counseling, and pastoral services 
- Bereavement counseling for the family up to one year after the patient’s death

#### Hospice Guidelines 

Although hospice care has become more widespread, these new programs are subjected to more rigorous insurance guidelines that dictate the types and amounts of medications used, length of stay, and types of patients who are eligible to receive hospice care (Weitz, 2007). Thus, more patients are being served, but providers have less control over the services they provide, and lengths of stay are more limited.

A recent report by the Office of the Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2018) highlighted some of the vulnerabilities of the hospice system in the United States. Among the concerns raised were that hospices did not always provide the care that was needed and sometimes the quality of that care was poor, even at Medicare-certified facilities. 

Not all racial and ethnic groups feel the same way about hospice care. African American families may believe that medical treatment should be pursued on behalf of an ill relative as long as possible and that only God can decide when a person dies. Chinese American families may feel very uncomfortable discussing issues of death or being near the deceased family member's body. The view that hospice care should always be used is not held by everyone, and healthcare providers need to be sensitive to the wishes and beliefs of those they serve (Coolen, 2012).

### Grief, Bereavement, and Mourning

The terms **grief**, **bereavement**, and **mourning **are often used interchangeably; however, they have different meanings. Grief is the normal process of reacting to a loss. Grief can be in response to a physical loss such as a death, or a social loss including a relationship or job. 

Bereavement is the period after a loss during which grief and mourning occur. The time spent in bereavement for the loss of a loved one depends on the circumstances of the loss and the level of attachment to the person who died. 

Mourning is the process by which people adapt to a loss. Mourning is greatly influenced by cultural beliefs, practices, and rituals (Casarett et al., 2001). 

#### Grief Reactions

Typical grief reactions involve mental, physical, social, and/or emotional responses. These reactions can include feelings of numbness, anger, guilt, anxiety, sadness, and despair. The individual can experience difficulty concentrating, sleep and eating problems, loss of interest in pleasurable activities, physical problems, and even illness.   
  
Research has demonstrated that the immune systems of individuals grieving are suppressed and their healthy cells behave more sluggishly, resulting in greater susceptibility to illnesses (Parkes & Prigerson, 2010). However, the intensity and duration of typical grief symptoms do not match those usually seen in severe grief reactions, and symptoms typically diminish within six to 10 weeks (Youdin, 2016). 

#### Complicated Grief

After the loss of a loved one, however, some individuals experience** complicated grief**, which includes atypical grief reactions (Newson et al., 2011). Symptoms of complicated grief include feelings of disbelief, a preoccupation with the dead loved one, distressful memories, feeling unable to move on with one’s life, and a yearning for the deceased. These symptoms may last six months or longer and mirror those seen in major depressive disorder (Youdin, 2016).

According to the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*, 5th ed. (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), distinguishing between major depressive disorder and complicated grief requires clinical judgment. The psychologist needs to evaluate the client’s individual history and determine whether the symptoms are focused entirely on the loss of the loved one and represent the individual’s cultural norms for grieving, which would be acceptable.   
  
Those who seek assistance for complicated grief usually have experienced traumatic forms of bereavement, such as unexpected, multiple, and violent deaths, or those due to murders or suicides (Parkes & Prigerson, 2010). 

#### Disenfranchised Grief

Grief that is not socially recognized is referred to as **disenfranchised grief** (Doka, 1989). Examples of disenfranchised grief include death due to AIDS, the suicide of a loved one, perinatal deaths, abortions, the death of a pet, lover, or ex-spouse, and psychological losses, such as a partner developing Alzheimer’s disease.   
  
Due to the type of loss, there are no formal mourning practices or recognition by others that would comfort the grieving individual. Consequently, individuals experiencing disenfranchised grief may suffer intensified symptoms due to the lack of social support (Parkes & Prigerson, 2010). 

#### Anticipatory Grief

Grief that occurs when a death is expected, and survivors have time to prepare to some extent before the loss, is referred to as **anticipatory grief**. This expectation can adjust to a loss somewhat easier (Kübler-Ross & Kessler, 2005). Death after a long-term, painful illness may bring family members a sense of relief that the suffering is over, and the exhausting process of caring for someone who is ill is also completed.  

### Models of Grief

There are several theoretical models of grief. However, none is all-encompassing (Youdin, 2016). These models are merely guidelines for what an individual may experience while grieving.

However, if individuals do not fit a model, it does not mean there is something “wrong” with the way they experience grief. It is important to remember that there is no one way to grieve, and people move through a variety of stages of grief in various ways.

#### Five Stages of Grief

Kübler-Ross (1969, 1975) describes five stages of loss experienced by someone who faces the news of their impending death. These "stages" are not really stages that a person goes through in order or only once; nor are they stages that occur with the same intensity.

Indeed, the process of death is influenced by a person's life experiences, the timing of their death in relation to life events, the predictability of their death based on health or illness, their belief system, and their assessment of the quality of their own life. Nevertheless, these stages help us to understand and recognize some of what a dying person experiences psychologically, and by understanding, we are more equipped to support that person as they die. 

- **Denial** is often the first reaction to overwhelming, unimaginable news. Denial, or disbelief or shock, protects us by allowing such news to enter slowly and to give us time to come to grips with what is taking place. The person who receives positive test results for life-threatening conditions may question the results, seek second opinions, or may simply feel a sense of disbelief psychologically even though they know that the results are true. 
- **Anger** provides protection in that being angry energizes people to fight against something and gives structure to a situation that may be thrusting them into the unknown. It is much easier to be angry than to be sad, in pain, or depressed. It helps us to temporarily believe that we have a sense of control over our future and to feel that we have at least expressed our rage about how unfair life can be. Anger can be focused on a person, a health care provider, God, or the world in general. It can be expressed over issues that have nothing to do with our death; consequently, being in this stage of loss is not always obvious. 
- **Bargaining** involves trying to think of what could be done to turn the situation around. Living better, devoting yourself to a cause, being a better friend, parent, or spouse, are all agreements one might willingly commit to if doing so would lengthen life. Asking to just live long enough to witness a family event or finish a task are examples of bargaining. 
- **Depression** or sadness is appropriate for such an event. Feeling the weight of loss, crying, and losing interest in the outside world is an important part of the process of dying. This depression makes others feel very uncomfortable, and family members may try to console their loved ones. Sometimes hospice care may include the use of antidepressants to reduce depression during this stage. 
- **Acceptance** involves learning how to carry on and to incorporate this aspect of the life span into daily existence. Reaching acceptance does not in any way imply that people who are dying are happy about it or content with it. It means that they are facing it and continuing to make arrangements and to say what they wish to say to others. Some terminally ill people find that they live life more fully than ever before after they come to this stage. According to Kübler-Ross (1969), behind these five stages focused on the identified emotions, there is a sense of hope. Kübler-Ross noted that in all the 200-plus patients she and her students interviewed, a little bit of hope that they might not die was always in the back of their minds.

### Criticisms of Kübler-Ross’s Five Stages of Grief:

Some researchers have been skeptical of the validity of there being stages to grief among the dying (Friedman & James, 2008). As Kübler-Ross notes in her own work, it is difficult to empirically test the experiences of the dying. “How do you do research on dying,…? When you cannot verify your data and cannot set up experiments?” (Kübler-Ross, 1969).

She and four students from the Chicago Theology Seminary in 1965 decided to listen to the experiences of dying patients, but her ideas about death and dying are based on the interviewers’ collective “feelings” about what the dying were experiencing and needed (Kübler-Ross, 1969). While she goes on to say in support of her approach that she and her students read nothing about the prior literature on death and dying, so as to have no preconceived ideas, a later work revealed that her own experiences of grief from childhood undoubtedly colored her perceptions of the grieving process (Kübler-Ross & Kessler, 2005).

Kübler-Ross is adamant in her theory that the one stage that all those who are dying go through is anger. It is clear from her 2005 book that anger played a central role in *her* grief and did so for many years (Friedman & James, 2008). 

There have been challenges to the notion that denial and acceptance are beneficial to the grieving process (Telford et al., 2006). Denial can become a barrier between the patient and health care specialists and reduce the ability to educate and treat the patient.

Similarly, acceptance of a terminal diagnosis may also lead patients to give up and forgo treatments to alleviate their symptoms. In fact, some research suggests that optimism about one’s prognosis may help in one’s adjustment and increase longevity (Taylor et al., 2000). 

A third criticism is not so much of Kübler-Ross’s work, but of how others have assumed that these stages apply to anyone who is grieving. Her research focused only on those who were terminally ill. This does not mean that others who are grieving the loss of someone would necessarily experience grief in the same way.

Friedman and James (2008) and Telford et al. (2006) expressed concern that mental health professionals, along with the general public, may assume that grief follows a set pattern, which may create more harm than good.

Lastly, the Yale Bereavement Study, completed between January 2000 and January 2003, did not find support for Kübler-Ross’s five-stage theory of grief (Maciejewski et al., 2007). Results indicated that acceptance was the most commonly reported reaction from the start, and yearning was the most common negative feature for the first two years. The other variables, such as disbelief, depression, and anger, were typically absent or minimal. 

Although there is criticism of the Five Stages of Grief Model, Kübler-Ross made people more aware of the needs and concerns of the dying, especially those who were terminally ill. As she notes, when a patient is severely ill, he is often treated like a person with no right to an opinion. It is often someone else who makes the decision if and when and where a patient should be hospitalized. It would take so little to remember that the sick person has feelings, has wishes and opinions, and has—most important of all—the right to be heard.

#### Dual-Process Model of Grieving

The dual-process model takes into consideration that bereaved individuals move back and forth between grieving and preparing for life without their loved one (Stroebe & Schut, 2001; Stroebe et al., 2005). This model focuses on a **loss orientation**, which emphasizes the feelings of loss and yearning for the deceased and a **restoration orientation**, which centers on the grieving individual reestablishing roles and activities they had prior to the death of their loved one.

When oriented toward loss grieving, individuals look back, and when oriented toward restoration, they look forward. As one cannot look both back and forward at the same time, a bereaved person must shift back and forth between the two. Both orientations facilitate normal grieving and interact until bereavement has completed.

### Grief: Loss of Children and Parents

#### Loss of a Child

According to Parkes and Prigerson (2010), the loss of a child at any age is considered “the most distressing and long-lasting of all griefs.” Bereaved parents suffer an increased risk to both physical and mental health and exhibit an increased mortality rate. Additionally, they earn higher scores on inventories of grief compared to other types of bereavement.   
  
Of those recently diagnosed with depression, a high percentage had experienced the death of a child within the preceding six months, and 8 percent of women whose child had died attempted or committed suicide. Archer (1999) found that the intensity of grief increased with the child’s age until the age of 17 when it declined. Archer explained that women have a greater chance of having another child when younger, and thus with added age comes greater grief as fertility declines. Certainly, the older the child the more the mother has bonded with the child and will experience greater grief. 

Even when children are adults, parents may experience intense grief, especially when the death is sudden. Adult children dying in traffic accidents was associated with parents experiencing more intense grief and depression, greater symptoms on a health check list, and more guilt than those parents whose adult children died from cancer (Parkes & Prigerson, 2010).   
  
Additionally, the deaths of unmarried adult children still residing at home and those who experienced alcohol and relationship problems were especially difficult for parents. Overall, in societies in which childhood deaths are statistically infrequent, parents are often unprepared for the loss of their daughter or son and suffer high levels of grief.

#### Loss of Parents in Adulthood

In contrast to the loss of a child, the loss of parents in adult life is much more common and results in less suffering. In their literature review, Moss and Moss (1995) found that the loss of a parent in adult life is “rarely pathological.” Those adult children who appear to have the most difficulty dealing with the loss of a parent are adult men who remain unmarried and continue to live with their mothers.   
  
In contrast, those who are in satisfying marriages are less likely to require grief assistance (Parkes & Prigerson, 2010). To determine the effects of gender on parental death, Marks et al. (2007) analyzed longitudinal data from the National Survey of Families and Households that assessed multiple dimensions of psychological well-being in adulthood including depression, happiness, self-esteem, mastery, psychological wellness, alcohol abuse, and physical health. Findings indicated that a father’s death led to more negative effects for sons than daughters, and a mother’s death led to more negative effects for daughters.

#### Loss of Parents in Childhood

Parental deaths in childhood have been associated with adjustment problems that may last into adulthood. Ellis et al. (2013) identified several negative outcomes associated with childhood grief including increased chance of substance abuse, greater susceptibility to depression, higher chance of criminal behavior, school underachievement, and lower employment rates. Typically, professional help is not required in helping children and teens who are dealing with the death of a loved one. 

However, Worden (2002) identified ten “red flags” displayed by grieving children that may indicate the need for professional assistance: 

- Persistent difficulty in talking about the dead person 
- Persistent or destructive aggressive behavior 
- Persisting anxiety, clinging, or fears 
- Somatic complaints (stomachaches, headaches) 
- Sleeping difficulties 
- Eating disturbance 
- Marked social withdrawal 
- School difficulties or serious academic reversal 
- Persistent self-blame or guilt 
- Self-destructive behavior 

As parents may also be dealing with funeral arrangements and other end-of-life matters, they may not always have the time to address questions and concerns that children may have.   
  
When explaining death to children it is important to use real words, such as died and death (Dresser & Wasserman, 2010). Children do not understand the meanings of such phrases as “passed away,” “left us,” or “lost,” and they can become confused as to what happened. Saying a loved one died of a disease called cancer is preferable to saying he was “very sick.” The child may become worried when others become sick that they too will die. Consequently, it is important that children have someone who will listen to and accurately address their concerns. 

### Mourning

Not all researchers agree that as a society, people are given the tools and time to adequately mourn. The "death-denying, grief-dismissing world" is the modern world (Kübler-Ross & Kessler, 2005, p. 205). We often grieve privately, quickly, and medicate our suffering with substances or activities. Employers grant three to five days for bereavement, if the loss is that of an immediate family member, and such leaves are sometimes limited to no more than once per year.

Yet grief takes much longer and the bereaved are seldom ready to perform well on the job after just a few days. Obviously, life does have to continue, but we need to acknowledge and make more caring accommodations for those who are in grief. 

#### Four Tasks of Mourning

Worden (2008) identified four tasks that facilitate the mourning process. Worden believes that all four tasks must be completed, but they may be completed in any order and for varying amounts of time. These tasks include: 

- Acceptance that the loss has occurred 
- Working through the pain of grief 
- Adjusting to life without the deceased 
- Starting a new life while still maintaining a connection with the deceased 

#### Support Groups

**Support groups** are helpful for grieving individuals of all ages, including those who are sick, terminal, caregiving, or mourning the loss of a loved one. Support groups reduce isolation, connect individuals with others who have similar experiences, and offer those grieving a place to share their pain and learn new ways of coping (Lynn & Harrold, 2011). Support groups are available through religious organizations, hospitals, hospices, nursing homes, mental health facilities, and schools for children.

Viewing death as an integral part of the lifespan will benefit those who are ill, those who are bereaved, and everyone as friends, caregivers, partners, family members, and humans in a global society. 

#### Key Terms

- **support groups:** groups of people with common experiences or concerns who provide each other with encouragement, comfort, and advice.
