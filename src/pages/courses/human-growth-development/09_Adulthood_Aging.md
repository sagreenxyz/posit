# Adulthood & Aging: A Comprehensive Reference Guide

## Introduction

Adulthood represents the longest period of the human lifespan, spanning potentially six or more decades from the mid-twenties through the end of life. This extended period encompasses dramatic physical, cognitive, and psychosocial changes, challenging outdated notions that adulthood represented a static plateau between adolescent growth and elderly decline. Contemporary developmental science recognizes adulthood as a dynamic period characterized by both gains and losses, stability and change, continuity and transformation.

The adult years can be conceptualized as several distinct phases, each with characteristic challenges, opportunities, and developmental tasks. Emerging adulthood (approximately ages 18-25) represents a transitional period between adolescence and full adult independence. Early adulthood (mid-twenties through mid-forties) typically involves establishing intimate relationships, building careers, and often starting families. Middle adulthood (mid-forties through mid-sixties) brings increased awareness of aging alongside peak productivity in many life domains. Late adulthood (65 and beyond) is increasingly subdivided into the "young-old" (65-84) who remain relatively healthy and active, and the "oldest-old" (85+) who face increasing health challenges and functional limitations.

This comprehensive guide examines the full spectrum of adult development and aging, exploring physical changes from the physiological peak of early adulthood through the accumulated effects of aging in late life, cognitive development including both declines in processing speed and gains in expertise and wisdom, and psychosocial development encompassing intimate relationships, career development, generativity, and preparation for the end of life. Understanding adult development is essential for individuals navigating their own life course, professionals working with adult populations, and society planning for an aging demographic future.

## Periods of Development in Adulthood

### Emerging Adulthood

The period of emerging adulthood is a transitional time between the end of adolescence and before individuals acquire all the benchmarks of adulthood. This developmental stage, identified by Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, is characterized by continued identity exploration and preparation for full independence from parents. Although individuals in this age range are at their physiological peak, emerging adults are most at risk for involvement in violent crimes and substance abuse.

Emerging adulthood is distinguished by several key features:

**Identity Exploration**: Emerging adults actively explore possibilities in love, work, and worldviews, trying out different relationships, jobs, and belief systems as they work toward more enduring choices.

**Instability**: Frequent changes in residence, relationships, and jobs characterize this period. Many emerging adults have not yet settled into stable long-term commitments.

**Self-Focus**: With fewer social obligations than adolescents (to parents) or established adults (to spouses and children), emerging adults have unprecedented freedom to focus on their own development.

**Feeling In-Between**: When asked if they feel they have reached adulthood, most emerging adults answer neither yes nor no but "in some ways yes, in some ways no."

**Possibilities**: Emerging adulthood is characterized by optimism, with most emerging adults believing they will achieve their goals and live lives better than their parents.

### Early Adulthood

The mid-twenties through mid-forties are identified as early adulthood. Intimate relationships, establishing families, and work are primary concerns at this stage of life. This period represents the transition from the exploratory nature of emerging adulthood to more stable, committed adult roles.

**Physical Peak**: By the time individuals reach early adulthood, physical maturation is complete. Those in their early twenties are probably at the peak of their physiological development by such measures as muscle strength, reaction time, sensory abilities, and cardiac functioning. The reproductive system, motor skills, strength, and lung capacity are all operating at their best. Most professional athletes are at the top of their game during this stage.

**Aging Begins**: The aging process actually begins during early adulthood. Around the age of 30, many changes begin to occur in different parts of the body. The lens of the eye starts to stiffen and thicken, resulting in changes in vision. Sensitivity to sound decreases, happening twice as quickly for men as for women. Hair can start to thin and become gray, and the skin becomes drier with wrinkles starting to appear by the end of early adulthood.

### Middle Adulthood

The mid-forties through the mid-sixties is referred to as middle adulthood. This is a period in which aging becomes more noticeable and when many people are at their peak of productivity in love and work. Middle adulthood may be the least studied time of the lifespan, with research on this developmental period being relatively new as many aspects of midlife are still being explored.

What is known is that this stage reflects both developmental gains and losses and that there are considerable individual differences. The large Baby Boom cohort (those born between 1946 and 1964) are now midlife adults, which has led to increased interest in this developmental stage.

**Primary vs. Secondary Aging**: Age-related physical changes during middle adulthood are experienced differently based on many factors. Biological factors such as molecular and cellular changes and oxidative damage are called primary aging factors. Aging that occurs due to controllable factors, such as unhealthy lifestyle including lack of physical exercise and poor diet, is called secondary aging.

### Late Adulthood

Late adulthood is sometimes subdivided into two categories: the young-old who are from 65 to 84 years of age and the oldest-old who are 85 years and older. One of the primary differences between these groups is that the young-old are still relatively healthy, productive, active, and the majority continue to live independently. With both age groups, the risks of diseases such as arteriosclerosis, cancer, and cerebral vascular disease increases substantially.

The young-old often continue working (either in paid employment or volunteer activities), maintain active social lives, and remain physically capable of independent living. Many enjoy travel, hobbies, and time with grandchildren. The oldest-old are more likely to experience significant health challenges, functional limitations, and need for assistance with daily activities.

## When Does Adulthood Begin?

Historically, the process of becoming an adult was more clearly marked by rites of passage. For many, marriage and parenthood were considered entry into adulthood. However, these role transitions are no longer considered the important markers of adulthood. Economic and social changes have resulted in more young adults attending college and a delay in marriage and having children.

**Contemporary Markers**: Current research has found financial independence and accepting responsibility for oneself to be the most important markers of adulthood in Western culture across age and ethnic groups. This represents a shift from external role transitions to internal qualities of character and self-sufficiency.

**Cultural Variation**: Research on college students' perceptions of adulthood found that some students still view rites of passage as important markers. College students who placed more importance on role transition markers such as parenthood and marriage were more likely to belong to a fraternity or sorority, be traditionally aged (18-25), belong to an ethnic minority, be of traditional marital status (not cohabitating), or belong to a religious organization.

These findings support the view that people holding collectivist or more traditional values place more importance on role transitions as markers of adulthood. In contrast, older college students and those cohabitating did not value role transitions as markers of adulthood as strongly.

## Physical Changes in Early Adulthood

### Physiological Peak

People in their mid-twenties to mid-forties are considered to be in early adulthood. By the time they reach early adulthood, physical maturation is complete, although height and weight may increase slightly. Those in their early twenties are probably at the peak of their physiological development. Most professional athletes are at the top of their game during this stage, and many women have children in the early-adulthood years.

The aging process begins during early adulthood. Around age 30, many changes begin to occur in different parts of the body. The lens of the eye starts to stiffen and thicken, resulting in vision changes (usually affecting the ability to focus on close objects). Sensitivity to sound decreases. Hair can start to thin and become gray around age 35. The skin becomes drier and wrinkles start to appear by the end of early adulthood.

People of this age see a decline in response time and the ability to recover quickly from physical exertion. The immune system becomes less adept at fighting off illness, and reproductive capacity starts to decline.

### Obesity Epidemic

Although at the peak of physical health, a concern for early adults is the current rate of obesity. Results indicate that an estimated 70.7 percent of U.S. adults aged 20 and over were overweight in 2012, and by 2016, 39.8 percent were considered obese.

**Body Mass Index (BMI)** is used to classify overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9), obesity (BMI ≥30.0), and extreme obesity (BMI ≥40.0). The CDC indicates that one's twenties are the prime time to gain weight, with the average person gaining one to two pounds per year from early adulthood into middle adulthood.

The American obesity crisis is reflected worldwide. In 2014, global obesity rates for men were 10.8 percent and among women, 14.9 percent. This translates to 266 million obese men and 375 million obese women worldwide, with more people identified as obese than underweight.

**Causes**: Obesity originates from a complex set of contributing factors including environment, behavior, and genetics. Societal factors include culture, education, food marketing, quality of food, and the physical activity environment. Behaviors include diet, physical activity amount, and medication use. Research has identified variants in several genes that may contribute to obesity by increasing hunger and food intake.

**Health Consequences**: Obesity is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide. Medical care costs were estimated at $147 billion in 2008. People who are obese are at increased risk for: mortality from all causes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, some cancers (endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, liver), low quality of life, and mental illness including depression and anxiety.

### Risk Behaviors in Early Adulthood

Doctor's visits are less frequent in early adulthood than in midlife and late adulthood, often necessitated primarily by injury and pregnancy. However, the top five causes of death in emerging and early adulthood are non-intentional injury (including motor vehicle accidents), homicide, and suicide, with cancer and heart disease completing the list.

Rates of violent death are highest among young adult males and vary by race and ethnicity. Males are three times more likely to die in auto accidents than females. Rates of violent death are higher in the United States than in Canada, Mexico, Japan, and other selected countries.

**Alcohol Abuse**: A significant contributing factor to risky behavior is alcohol. According to 2014 data, 88 percent of people aged 18 or older reported drinking alcohol at some point in their lifetime, and 6.7 percent engaged in heavy drinking in the past month (five or more drinks on the same occasion on each of five or more days). Nearly 88,000 people die from alcohol-related causes annually, making it the fourth leading preventable cause of death.

**Binge Drinking**: Defined as producing blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 g/dL, this typically occurs after four drinks for women or five for men in about two hours. In 2014, 25 percent of people aged 18 or older engaged in binge drinking in the past month.

**College Students and Alcohol**: Results show differences between college students and non-students. Sixty percent of full-time college students aged 18-22 drank alcohol in the past month versus 51.5 percent of non-students. Thirty-eight percent of college students engaged in binge drinking versus 33.5 percent of non-students. Twelve percent engaged in heavy drinking versus 9.5 percent of non-students.

Each year, 1,825 college students aged 18-24 die from alcohol-related unintentional injuries, 696,000 are assaulted by another student who has been drinking, and approximately one in five meet criteria for an Alcohol Use Disorder.

**Drug Use**: Illicit drug use peaks between ages 19 and 22 and then begins to decline. Emerging adults (18-25) are the largest abusers of prescription opioid pain relievers, anti-anxiety medications, and ADHD medication. Daily marijuana use is at the highest level in three decades, with 6 percent of college students smoking marijuana daily in 2014.

## Physical Changes in Middle Adulthood

### Age-Related Changes

Middle adulthood refers to the period from 40-45 through 60-65. Each person experiences age-related physical changes differently based on many factors. Getting out of shape is not an inevitable part of aging; it is probably due to middle-aged adults becoming less physically active and experiencing greater stress.

Smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, having a poor diet, stress, physical inactivity, and chronic disease all reduce overall health. However, adopting a healthier lifestyle can combat many of these changes.

### Hair, Skin, and Muscle Changes

**Hair**: Hair color is due to melanin produced by hair follicles. With aging, follicles produce less melanin, causing hair to become gray. Hair color typically starts turning lighter at the temples but eventually all hair becomes white. Graying begins in the thirties for many but is largely determined by genes. Almost everyone has some hair loss with aging, and the rate of hair growth slows. Many men show signs of balding by 30, with some nearly bald by 60.

**Skin**: Skin continues to dry out and becomes prone to wrinkling, particularly on the face. Wrinkles are a normal part of aging. As people age, skin dries and loses the underlying layer of fat, so faces no longer appear smooth. Loss of muscle tone and thinning skin make the face appear flabby or drooping. Although genetics plays a role, frequent sun exposure and smoking cause wrinkles to appear sooner.

**Sarcopenia**: The loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with aging is referred to as sarcopenia. This is a significant factor in frailty and functional impairment when older. The decline of growth and anabolic hormones, especially testosterone, and decreased physical activity have been implicated as causes. The decline can occur as early as 40 and contributes to decreased life quality, increased health care costs, and early death.

**Lungs**: The lungs supply oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. Thinning bones can change rib cage shape and reduce lung expansion. Age-related muscle weakening, including the diaphragm, can also reduce lung capacity. Both changes lower oxygen levels and increase carbon dioxide, causing shortness of breath and fatigue. In middle adulthood, these changes are often minimal, especially in non-smokers who are physically active.

### Sensory Changes

**Vision - Presbyopia**: A normal age-related change is presbyopia ("old vision"), which is loss of lens elasticity making it harder to focus on close objects. Anyone over 35 is at risk. Signs include difficulty reading small print, holding reading material farther away, problems seeing close objects, headaches, and eyestrain.

**Floaters**: Little spots or "cobwebs" that float in the field of vision, most noticeable looking at the sky or lighted screens. These occur when the vitreous body (gel-like substance in the eye) slowly shrinks and becomes stringy, casting shadows on the retina. Usually harmless but can indicate serious problems if appearing suddenly.

**Night Vision**: Adults may notice a drop in scotopic sensitivity (ability to see in dimmer light). By age 60, the retina receives only one-third as much light as at age 20. Night vision is affected as the pupil loses ability to open and close for drastic light changes. Eyes become more sensitive to glare from headlights and street lights.

**Dry Eye Syndrome**: Occurs when the eye does not produce tears properly or when tears evaporate too quickly. Nearly five million Americans over 50 experience dry eye. It affects women more than men, especially after menopause.

**Hearing**: Hearing problems increase during middle adulthood. The rate doubles between ages 40 and 55 and triples by 64. Prior to age 40, about 5.5 percent of adults report hearing problems; this jumps to 19 percent among 40- to 69-year-olds. Middle-aged adults experience more problems understanding speech in noisy environments. As people age, they lose the ability to hear higher frequencies. Hearing changes are more common among men than women. Hearing loss accumulates after years of exposure to intense noise and is exacerbated by smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke.

## Major Health Concerns in Middle Adulthood

### Heart Disease

Heart disease continues to be the number one cause of death for Americans and worldwide. It claimed 23 percent of those who died in 2017. Heart disease develops slowly over time and typically appears in midlife.

**Cardiovascular Disease**: Narrowed, blocked, or stiffened blood vessels prevent the body and heart from receiving adequate blood. Atherosclerosis, a buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, is the most common cause. The plaque buildup thickens artery walls and restricts blood flow to organs and tissues, potentially leading to heart attack, chest pain, or stroke.

**Symptoms**: Differ for men and women. Males are more likely to suffer chest pain, while women are more likely to demonstrate shortness of breath, nausea, and extreme fatigue. Symptoms can also include pain in arms, legs, neck, jaw, throat, abdomen, and back.

**Risk Factors**: Include advanced age, sex (males at greater risk, but female risk increases after menopause), family history, smoking, poor diet, excessive alcohol consumption, stress, and poor hygiene.

**Complications**: Include heart failure (when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet body's needs) and heart attack (when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the heart). Sudden cardiac arrest is unexpected loss of heart functioning, breathing, and consciousness, often caused by abnormal heartbeat.

### Cancer

Cancer was the second leading cause of death for Americans in 2017, accounting for 21.3 percent of all deaths. Cancer is the name given to a collection of related diseases in which the body's cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues. These extra cells can divide and form growths called tumors.

**Malignant vs. Benign**: Cancerous tumors are malignant, meaning they can invade nearby tissues. When removed, malignant tumors may grow back. Benign tumors do not invade nearby tissues and when removed usually do not grow back, though benign brain tumors can be life-threatening.

**Cancer Development**: Cancer cells can prompt nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients. Cancer cells can hide from the immune system and metastasize (break away and travel through lymph or blood to form new tumors elsewhere).

**Common Types**: There are more than 100 types of cancer. The most common in the United States include breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, kidney and renal pelvis cancer, leukemia, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, and uterine cancer.

### Diabetes

Diabetes mellitus is a disease in which the body does not control the amount of glucose in the blood, occurring when the body does not make enough insulin or does not use it properly. In adults, 90-95 percent of diagnosed cases are Type 2.

**Type 2 Diabetes**: Usually begins with insulin resistance, where cells in muscles, liver, and fatty tissue do not use insulin properly. As the need for insulin increases, pancreatic cells gradually lose the ability to produce enough insulin. In some diabetics, beta cells cease functioning entirely, requiring insulin injections.

**Prediabetes**: One in three adults are estimated to have prediabetes, with nine out of ten unaware. Without intervention, 15-30 percent will develop diabetes within five years. In 2015, 30.2 million people (9.4 percent of population) were living with diabetes. The median age of diagnosis is 54.

**Ethnic Differences**: Non-Hispanic Whites are less likely to be diagnosed than Asian Americans, Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives. Educational attainment correlates with diabetes rates.

**Risk Factors**: Include over age 45, obesity, family history, history of gestational diabetes, race/ethnicity, physical inactivity, and diet.

**Complications**: Diabetes has been linked to numerous health complications. Adults with diabetes are 1.7 times more likely to have cardiovascular disease, 1.8 times more likely to experience heart attack, and 1.5 times more likely to experience stroke. Diabetes can cause blindness and eye problems (diabetic retinopathy), is the primary cause of almost half of new kidney failure cases annually, is linked to 60 percent of non-traumatic limb amputations, and has been linked to hearing loss, tinnitus, gum disease, and neuropathy.

### Metabolic Syndrome

Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors including large waist circumference, high blood pressure, and elevated triglycerides, LDL, and blood glucose levels. It can lead to diabetes and heart disease. The prevalence in the United States is approximately 34 percent, especially high among Hispanics and African Americans.

Prevalence increases with age, peaking in one's sixties. Metabolic syndrome increases the severity of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Having even one or two risk factors increases mortality risk. Increasing aerobic activity and reducing weight leads to drops in many risk factors.

### Rheumatoid Arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease causing pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in joints. It occurs when the immune system attacks the membrane lining joints. RA is the second most common form of arthritis after osteoarthritis.

Unlike osteoarthritis, RA is symmetric in its attack—if one shoulder is affected, so is the other. Those with RA may experience fatigue and fever. About 1.5 million Americans (0.6 percent) experience RA. It occurs across all races and age groups but often begins in middle adulthood and occurs with increased frequency in older people. Two to three times as many women as men have the disease.

**Genetics**: Genes play a role in RA development, though individual genes by themselves confer only small risk. Some people with particular genes never develop RA. Scientists think something must trigger the disease in genetically susceptible people. Hormonal factors may be involved—symptoms may improve during pregnancy and flare after, and oral contraceptive use may increase likelihood of developing RA.

RA can affect virtually every area of life and interfere with work and family. Current treatment strategies allow most people with RA to lead active lives. Pain-relieving drugs and medications can slow joint damage, and establishing balance between rest and exercise can lessen symptoms.

### Sleep Issues

Adults require at least seven hours of sleep per night to avoid health risks associated with chronic sleep deprivation. Less than six hours and more than 10 hours are not recommended for middle adulthood. Many Americans do not receive the recommended seven to nine hours. In 2013, only 59 percent met that standard, while in 1942, 84 percent did.

**Sleep Problems**: Nine percent of Americans report being diagnosed with a sleep disorder; of those, 71 percent have sleep apnea and 24 percent suffer from insomnia. Pain contributes to the difference between needed sleep and actual sleep—an average of 42 minutes of sleep debt for those with chronic pain.

Stress and poor health are key components of shorter sleep durations and worse sleep quality. Those in midlife with lower life satisfaction experienced greater delay in sleep onset than those with higher life satisfaction. Menopause can affect women's sleep duration and quality.

**Consequences**: Sleep deprivation suppresses immune responses, can lead to obesity, memory impairment, and hypertension. Insufficient sleep is linked to increased risk for colon cancer, breast cancer, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes. Lack of sleep can increase stress as cortisol remains elevated, keeping the body in alertness and hyperarousal that increases blood pressure.

Sleep is associated with longevity. Older adults with better sleep patterns live longer. During deep sleep, growth hormone is released that stimulates protein synthesis and cell division and breaks down fat for energy. Decreased deep sleep contributes to less growth hormone release and subsequent physical decline in aging.

## Temperament and Personality in Adulthood

### Temperament Stability

Temperament is defined as innate characteristics of the infant, including mood, activity level, and emotional reactivity, noticeable soon after birth. Does temperament remain stable throughout the lifespan? Research indicates temperamental stability holds for many individuals, yet environment can also have significant impact.

Research has shown that children identified as easy grew up to become well-adjusted adults, while those with difficult temperament were not as well-adjusted. Studies of inhibition to the unfamiliar showed that highly reactive infants demonstrated temperamental stability into early childhood, with shyness in infancy linked to social anxiety in adulthood.

Young adults previously identified as strongly inhibited toddlers showed heightened activation of the amygdala when compared to those identified as uninhibited toddlers. Environmental factors are thought to change gene expression by switching genes on and off. Many cultural and environmental factors can affect temperament, including supportive versus abusive child-rearing, socioeconomic status, stable homes, illnesses, and teratogens.

Because temperament is genetically driven, genes appear to be the major reason temperament remains stable into adulthood. In contrast, environment appears mainly responsible for any change in temperament.

### The Big Five Personality Traits

Personality traits refer to characteristic, routine ways of thinking, feeling, and relating to others. Personality integrates temperament with cultural and environmental influences. The Five-Factor Model organizes hundreds of personality traits into five broad dimensions:

**Openness to Experience**: General appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, imagination, curiosity, and variety of experience. Those high in openness tend to have distinctive and unconventional decorations, diverse book and music collections, and displayed art.

**Conscientiousness**: The tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement. Conscientious individuals prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior.

**Extraversion**: The tendency to experience positive emotions and seek stimulation and company of others. Extroverts enjoy being with people, like to talk, assert themselves, and draw attention.

**Agreeableness**: The tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic. Agreeable individuals value getting along, are considerate, friendly, generous, helpful, and willing to compromise.

**Neuroticism**: The tendency to experience negative emotions like anger, anxiety, or depression. Those high in neuroticism interpret ordinary situations as threatening and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. They may have trouble thinking clearly, making decisions, and coping effectively with stress.

### Personality Changes in Adulthood

Contemporary research shows that although some people's personalities are relatively stable over time, others are not. Longitudinal studies reveal average changes during adulthood in expression of some traits—neuroticism and openness decrease with age, conscientiousness increases—and individual differences in these patterns due to idiosyncratic life events like divorce or illness.

Longitudinal research suggests that adult personality traits such as conscientiousness predict important life outcomes including job success, health, and longevity. Conscientiousness is related to lower blood pressure, lower rates of diabetes and stroke, fewer joint problems, being less likely to engage in harmful behaviors, more likely to stick to healthy behaviors, and more likely to avoid stressful situations.

Conscientiousness also appears related to career choices, friendships, and stability of marriage. A person possessing both self-control and organizational skills may withstand the effects of aging better and have stronger cognitive skills.

## Psychosocial Development in Adulthood

### Erikson's Intimacy vs. Isolation

Erikson's sixth stage focuses on establishing intimate relationships or risking social isolation. Intimate relationships are more difficult if one is still struggling with identity. Although identity formation is a lifelong process, once basic identity is established, intimate relationships can be pursued.

These intimate relationships include acquaintanceships and friendships, but also the more important close relationships developed with another person in long-term romantic relationships such as marriage. Having others like and believe in the same things we do makes us feel validated in our beliefs—this is consensual validation and an important aspect of attraction.

### Attachment in Young Adulthood

Hazan and Shaver described attachment styles of adults using the same three general categories as Ainsworth's research: secure, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent. Adults were asked to think about romantic relationships and select the paragraph that best described the way they felt, thought, and behaved in these relationships.

**Secure**: "I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable depending on them and having them depend on me. I don't often worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me."

**Avoidant**: "I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when anyone gets too close, and often, love partners want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being."

**Anxious/Ambivalent**: "I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesn't really love me or won't stay with me. I want to merge completely with another person, and this sometimes scares people away."

Bartholomew suggested adult attachment is best described along two dimensions: attachment-related anxiety (worrying whether a partner really loves them, fearing rejection/abandonment) and attachment-related avoidance (discomfort opening up to others and depending on them, fearing dependency limits autonomy).

This yields four possible attachment styles: secure (low on both dimensions), dismissing (low anxiety, high avoidance), preoccupied (high anxiety, low avoidance), and fearful-avoidant (high on both dimensions).

**Research Findings**:
- Adults with insecure attachments report lower relationship satisfaction
- Those high in attachment-related anxiety report more daily conflict
- Those with avoidant attachment exhibit less support to partners
- Young adults show greater attachment-related anxiety than middle-aged or older adults
- Young adults with more secure relationships with parents make the transition to adulthood more easily
- Young adults with secure attachments and authoritative parents were less likely to be depressed

### Sternberg's Triangle of Love

Sternberg suggests there are three main components of love: passion, intimacy, and commitment. Love relationships vary depending on the presence or absence of each component.

**Passion**: The intense, physical attraction partners feel toward one another
**Intimacy**: The ability to share feelings, psychological closeness, and personal thoughts
**Commitment**: The conscious decision to stay together

**Types of Love**:

**Liking**: Intimacy without passion or commitment—partners are friends

**Infatuation**: Passion without intimacy or commitment—"love at first sight," short-lived

**Empty Love**: Commitment without intimacy or passion—staying together for children, religious conviction, or lack of alternatives

**Romantic Love**: Intimacy and passion without commitment—spending time together but not planning to continue

**Companionate Love**: Intimacy and commitment without passion—good friends committed to staying together

**Fatuous Love**: Passion and commitment without intimacy—premature commitment based on physical attraction

**Consummate Love**: All three components present—often perceived as the ideal in Western cultures

## Relationships in Adulthood

### Singlehood

Being single is the most common lifestyle for people in their early twenties, and there has been an increase in adults staying single. In 1960, only about one in 10 adults aged 25+ had never been married; in 2012 that had risen to one in five. While just over half (53 percent) of unmarried adults say they would eventually like to marry, 32 percent are unsure, and 13 percent do not want to marry.

Today's adults are marrying later, cohabitating, and raising children outside of marriage in greater numbers. Young adults have other priorities like education and establishing careers. In a Pew Research survey, slightly more adults (50 percent) agreed that "society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children" than those who chose "society is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority" (46 percent).

**Reasons for Staying Single**: Have not met the right person (30%), do not have financial stability (27%), not ready to settle down (22%), too young to marry (22%).

### Cohabitation

Cohabitation has become increasingly commonplace in American society and other cultures. For many emerging adults, cohabitation has become more common than marriage. While marriage is still more common for those aged 25-34, cohabitation has increased while marriage has declined.

Cohabitation varies by socioeconomic status—those who are married tend to have higher education levels and thus higher earnings or earning potential. From 1995 to 2010, the median length of cohabitation relationships increased regardless of outcome (marriage, remaining intact, or dissolving). In 1995, median length was 13 months; by 2010 it was 22 months.

**Rise in Western Cultures**: Three explanations have been given:
1. Increase in individualism and secularism, with decline in religious observance, leading to greater acceptance
2. Economic changes and modernization improving women's social status, leading to greater gender equality and sexual freedom
3. Change in employment requirements, with jobs requiring advanced education, creating competition between marriage and pursuing post-secondary education

Similar increases have occurred in other industrialized countries, with high rates in Great Britain, Australia, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. The lowest rates are in Ireland, Italy, and Japan.

### Marriage

Marriage has declined universally during the last several decades in both poor and rich countries. The countries with biggest drops were mostly rich: France, Italy, Germany, Japan, and the United States. The decline is due to both individuals delaying marriage and high rates of non-marital cohabitation.

**In the United States**: In 1960, 72 percent of adults aged 18+ were married; in 2010 this had dropped to barely half. The average age for first marriage was 20 for women and 23 for men in 1960; by 2021 this had increased to 28 for women and 30 for men.

**Same-Sex Marriage**: On June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution guarantees same-sex marriage. This occurred 11 years after same-sex marriage was first made legal in Massachusetts. Worldwide, 29 countries currently have national laws allowing same-sex marriage, located mostly in Europe and the Americas.

**Cultural Influences**: Many cultures have explicit and unstated rules about appropriate mates. Rules of endogamy indicate groups people should marry within. These rules encourage homogamy (marriage between people who share social characteristics). Most U.S. marriages are homogamous with respect to race, social class, age, and to a lesser extent, religion.

**Arranged Marriages**: Historically, marriage was not a personal choice but one made by family. Around the world, more young couples are choosing their partners, even in nations where arranged marriages are the norm like India and Pakistan. As the number of arranged marriages in India is declining, elopement is increasing.

**Predictors of Marital Harmony**: John Gottman's research differs from many marriage counselors in his belief that having a good marriage does not depend on compatibility but rather on how partners communicate. In marriages destined to fail, partners engage in the "marriage killers": contempt, criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling (shutting someone out). Stonewalling is the strongest sign a relationship is destined to fail.

## Erikson's Generativity

According to Erikson, generativity encompasses procreativity, productivity, and creativity. This stage includes the generation of new beings, new products, and new ideas, as well as self-generation concerned with further identity development. Erikson believed the stage of generativity, during which one establishes family and career, was the longest of all stages.

Individuals at midlife are primarily concerned with leaving a positive legacy of themselves, with parenthood being the primary generative type. Erikson understood that work and family relationships may be in conflict due to obligations and responsibilities, but he believed it was overall a positive developmental time. In addition to being parents and working, Erikson described individuals being involved in the community during this stage.

A sense of stagnation occurs when one is not active in generative matters; however, stagnation can motivate a person to redirect energies into more meaningful activities.

**Virtues**: Erikson identified "care" as the virtue emerging when one achieves generativity. He believed those in middle adulthood should "take care of the persons, the products, and the ideas one has learned to care for." Furthermore, Erikson believed the strengths gained from the six earlier stages are essential for the generational task of cultivating strength in the next generation. Generativity occurred best after the individual had resolved issues of identity and intimacy.

**Characteristics**: Research has demonstrated that generative adults possess many positive characteristics including good cultural knowledge and healthy adaptation to the world. Using the Big 5 personality traits, generative women and men scored high on conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience, and low on neuroticism.

Women scoring high in generativity at age 52 were rated high in positive personality characteristics, satisfaction with marriage and motherhood, and successful aging at age 62. Men rated higher in generativity at midlife were associated with stronger global cognitive functioning, stronger executive functioning, and lower levels of depression in late adulthood.

**Challenges**: Erikson indicated that at the end of this demanding stage, individuals may withdraw as generativity is no longer expected in late adulthood. This releases elders from the task of caretaking or working. However, not feeling needed or challenged may result in stagnation, and consequently one should not fully withdraw from generative tasks as they enter Erikson's last stage in late adulthood.

## Conclusion

Adulthood and aging represent the longest and most complex period of human development, encompassing dramatic changes across physical, cognitive, and psychosocial domains. The research reviewed in this guide demonstrates that adulthood is far from a static plateau but rather a dynamic process characterized by both gains and losses, stability and change.

The physical changes of adulthood follow a clear trajectory—from the physiological peak of the twenties through the gradual accumulation of age-related changes in middle adulthood to the more pronounced declines of late life. However, the research on primary versus secondary aging reminds us that many changes once attributed to inevitable aging are actually the result of lifestyle choices. Regular exercise, healthy diet, adequate sleep, and avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol can substantially delay or reduce many age-related changes.

The cognitive changes of adulthood are more nuanced than simple decline. While processing speed and certain aspects of memory show age-related decrements, many forms of expertise, practical problem-solving, and wisdom increase with age and experience. The psychosocial development of adulthood encompasses some of life's most significant challenges and achievements—establishing intimate relationships, building careers, raising children, contributing to communities, and preparing for life's end.

Erikson's concepts of intimacy versus isolation in early adulthood and generativity versus stagnation in middle adulthood provide useful frameworks for understanding the major developmental tasks of these periods. The research on attachment in adulthood demonstrates continuity from early experiences while also showing that attachment patterns can change through significant relationships and life experiences.

The diversity of adult life paths has increased dramatically. People are marrying later or not at all, having fewer children or none, cohabiting more, divorcing and remarrying, and creating families in diverse configurations. What remains constant is the human need for connection, meaning, and contribution—needs that can be met through various life structures.

Understanding adult development has practical implications for individuals, families, and society. For individuals, recognizing developmental tasks and normative changes can help in navigating life transitions and making informed choices. For families, understanding adult development can improve intergenerational relationships and support. For society, as populations age worldwide, understanding adult development and aging becomes increasingly important for policy, healthcare, work, and social structures.

The future will likely bring continued change in adult development patterns as technology, economics, and social norms evolve. Longer life expectancies, changing work patterns, new family forms, and technological advances will all shape how adults develop and age. What seems certain is that adulthood will remain a period of continued growth, adaptation, and possibility across the full lifespan.
