    - **Middle Adulthood**: 40-45 to 65 years.
    - **Late Adulthood**: 65 years onward.
  - **Prenatal Development Stages**:
    - **Germinal Period (Conception - 2 weeks)**:
      - Begins with fertilization (sperm + egg = **zygote**).
      - **Mitosis**: Rapid cell division forms a **blastocyst** (100 cells) after 5 days.
      - **Implantation**: Blastocyst embeds in uterine wall. High failure rate (50-75%).
    - **Embryonic Period (3rd - 8th week)**:
      - Organism is an **embryo**. **Placenta** forms for nourishment.
      - Growth follows **Cephalocaudal** (head-to-tail) and **Proximodistal** (midline-outward) patterns.
      - Major organs form; most vulnerable period for **teratogens**.
    - **Fetal Period (9th week - Birth)**:
      - Organism is a **fetus**.
      - **Early (9w-3m)**: Genitalia, hair, nails, teeth form.
      - **Middle (4-6m)**: Senses develop, reflexes (sucking), sleep cycles. **Viability** reached ~24 weeks.
      - **Late (7-9m)**: Lung development, weight gain, fat layer formation.

      - **Over 35**: Higher risk of fertility issues, miscarriage, genetic disorders (e.g., Down syndrome), and complications like high BP/diabetes.
      - **Teenage**: Higher risk of premature birth, low birth weight, anemia, and high BP due to lack of care/lifestyle.
    - **Health Conditions**:
      - **Gestational Diabetes**: High blood sugar; risks include large baby, preeclampsia, premature birth.
      - **Hypertension**: Gestational or chronic high blood pressure; can lead to preeclampsia.

  - **Socioeconomic Class and Emerging Adulthood**:
    - **Impact of SES**: Socioeconomic class impacts physical and mental well-being.
    - **Arnett's Findings**:
      - Emerging adults from lower SES classes identified more negativity in their emotional lives, including higher levels of depression.
      - Those in the lowest SES group were more likely to agree that they had not been able to find sufficient financial support to obtain the education they believed they needed.
  - **Temperament and Personality in Adulthood**:
    - **Temperament**: Innate characteristics including mood, activity level, and emotional reactivity.
    - **Stability**: Research indicates temperamental stability holds for many individuals, but environment can have a significant impact.
      - **Inhibition**: Highly reactive infants (inhibition to the unfamiliar) show temperamental stability into early childhood; shyness in infancy is linked to social anxiety in adulthood.
      - **Amygdala**: Young adults identified as inhibited toddlers showed heightened activation of the amygdala.
    - **Personality**: Characteristic manner of thinking, feeling, behaving, and relating to others. Integrates temperament with cultural and environmental influences.

  - **The Dying Process**:
    - **Physical Changes**:
      - **Weeks Before**: Appetite loss, increased sleep, weakness.
      - **Days Before**: Decreased consciousness, "death rattle" (noisy breathing), cooling of extremities, mottling (discoloration).
  - **Causes and Location**:
    - **Causes**: Shift from infectious diseases (1900s) to chronic diseases (Heart Disease, Cancer, Stroke).
    - **Location**: Most prefer to die at home (80%), but most die in hospitals (60%) or nursing homes (20%).
  - **Developmental Perspectives**:
    - **Childhood**:
      - **Early**: View death as temporary/reversible (sleep). May feel responsible (magical thinking).
      - **Middle**: Understand finality but may still feel guilt.
      - **Late**: Understand universality.
    - **Adolescence**: Abstract understanding but "Personal Fable" leads to feeling immune.

      - **Anticipatory Grief**: Grief experienced before the death occurs.
    - **Theories**:
      - **Kübler-Ross (Five Stages)**: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance. (Critique: Not universal or linear).
      - **Dual-Process Model**: Oscillating between **Loss Orientation** (coping with loss) and **Restoration Orientation** (adjusting to new life).
      - **Worden's Tasks**: Accept reality, process pain, adjust to world without deceased, find enduring connection while moving forward.
