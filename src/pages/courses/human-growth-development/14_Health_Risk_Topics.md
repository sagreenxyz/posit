# Document 14: Health and Risk Topics Across the Lifespan

## Introduction

Health and risk behaviors represent critical aspects of human development that significantly impact physical well-being, psychological functioning, and overall quality of life across the lifespan. While all developmental periods present unique health challenges, certain conditions and risk behaviors become particularly salient during specific life stages. Understanding these health and risk topics—including obesity, eating disorders, substance use and abuse, sexually transmitted infections, mental health disorders, self-harm and suicide, sleep disorders, injury and violence, and chronic health conditions—is essential for promoting optimal development, preventing negative outcomes, and intervening effectively when problems arise.

Health behaviors established in childhood and adolescence often persist into adulthood, making early prevention and intervention crucial. The transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood represents a particularly vulnerable period, as individuals gain independence while their prefrontal cortex continues developing, sometimes resulting in increased risk-taking without full consideration of consequences. Middle and late adulthood bring different health challenges, as chronic conditions become more prevalent and the cumulative effects of earlier health behaviors manifest.

This document examines major health and risk topics across developmental periods, exploring their prevalence, causes, consequences, and evidence-based approaches to prevention and treatment. By understanding these health challenges within a developmental framework, we can better appreciate how biological maturation, cognitive development, social contexts, and individual choices interact to influence health outcomes throughout life.

## Obesity

### Definition and Measurement

Obesity is defined as excessive body fat accumulation that presents health risks. Body mass index (BMI), expressed as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m²), is the most commonly used measure to classify weight status. For adults, BMI categories include:

- **Underweight:** BMI below 18.5
- **Normal weight:** BMI 18.5 to 24.9
- **Overweight:** BMI 25.0 to 29.9
- **Obese:** BMI 30.0 or higher
- **Extremely obese:** BMI 40.0 or higher

For children and adolescents, BMI percentiles adjusted for age and sex are used, with obesity defined as BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex.

### Prevalence Across the Lifespan

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and globally. According to recent data, approximately 70.7 percent of U.S. adults aged 20 and over are overweight, with 39.8 percent classified as obese and 6.4 percent as extremely obese. The prevalence increases with age, with individuals in their twenties averaging 185 pounds for men and 162 pounds for women, increasing to approximately 200 pounds and 170 pounds respectively by their thirties.

Among children and adolescents, obesity rates have tripled since 1980. In 2014, 20.5 percent of children aged 2 to 19 were obese, compared with only 5 percent in 1980. This dramatic increase has led to concerns that today's children may have shorter lifespans than their parents—the first generation in modern history to face this prospect.

The obesity crisis extends globally, with the 2014 worldwide obesity rates measured at 10.8 percent for men and 14.9 percent for women, totaling 266 million obese men and 375 million obese women. More people globally are now classified as obese than underweight, representing a major shift in public health challenges.

### Causes of Obesity

Obesity results from complex interactions among genetic, environmental, behavioral, and metabolic factors:

**Genetic Factors:** While no single gene causes obesity, research has identified variants in several genes that may contribute by increasing hunger and food intake. One theory suggests a mismatch between modern environments and "energy-thrifty genes" that evolved when food sources were unpredictable. Genes that helped ancestors survive occasional famines are now challenged by environments where food is constantly available.

**Environmental Factors:** The obesogenic environment includes the pervasive availability of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods; large portion sizes; food marketing targeting children; and built environments that discourage physical activity. The food environment has dramatically changed, with increased access to processed foods, fast food restaurants, and sugar-sweetened beverages.

**Behavioral Factors:** Individual behaviors contributing to obesity include poor dietary choices (high intake of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium), physical inactivity, sedentary lifestyles dominated by screen time, and irregular eating patterns. The average American consumes about 15 percent of daily calories from added sugars (equivalent to about 22 teaspoons daily), far exceeding the recommended maximum of 10 percent.

**Metabolic Changes:** Metabolism—the process by which the body converts food into energy—slows with age. The twenties represent a prime time for weight gain, with the average person gaining one to two pounds per year from early adulthood into middle adulthood. This occurs partly because muscle mass decreases with age, and since muscle burns more calories than fat, metabolic rate decreases even if dietary intake remains constant.

**Psychological Factors:** Stress, depression, anxiety, and emotional eating contribute to obesity. Some individuals use food as a coping mechanism for negative emotions, creating patterns of overeating that lead to weight gain.

### Health Consequences

Obesity significantly increases the risk for numerous serious diseases and health conditions, making it one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States and worldwide. Medical care costs associated with obesity were estimated at $147 billion in 2008.

**Mortality:** Obesity increases all-cause mortality risk. The relationship is particularly strong for extreme obesity, which dramatically reduces life expectancy.

**Cardiovascular Disease:** Obesity contributes to high blood pressure (hypertension), high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides (dyslipidemia), coronary heart disease, and stroke. The excess body fat, particularly visceral fat around organs, promotes inflammation and metabolic dysfunction affecting the cardiovascular system.

**Metabolic Disorders:** Type 2 diabetes is strongly linked to obesity, as excess body fat contributes to insulin resistance. Obesity also increases risk for metabolic syndrome—a cluster of conditions including large waist circumference, high blood pressure, and elevated triglycerides, LDL, and blood glucose levels.

**Musculoskeletal Problems:** Carrying excess weight places additional stress on joints, particularly knees and hips, leading to osteoarthritis—breakdown of cartilage and bone within joints. This creates a cycle where pain limits physical activity, potentially leading to further weight gain.

**Respiratory Issues:** Obesity is associated with sleep apnea (breathing interruptions during sleep) and other breathing problems. The excess weight around the neck and chest can obstruct airways during sleep and make breathing more labored during waking hours.

**Cancer:** Obesity increases risk for several cancers, including endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, and liver cancer. The mechanisms involve hormonal changes, chronic inflammation, and metabolic alterations associated with excess body fat.

**Mental Health:** Individuals with obesity often experience depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, negative body image, and reduced quality of life. These psychological consequences can result from social stigma, discrimination, and the physical limitations obesity creates, while also potentially contributing to further weight gain through emotional eating and reduced physical activity.

**Other Complications:** Additional health consequences include gallbladder disease, fatty liver disease, pregnancy complications, reduced fertility, and overall diminished physical functioning.

### Prevention and Treatment

**Prevention Strategies:**

Preventing obesity requires multi-level interventions addressing individual, family, community, and societal factors:

- **Early Intervention:** Establishing healthy eating patterns and physical activity habits in childhood is crucial, as childhood obesity often persists into adulthood.
- **Nutrition Education:** Teaching individuals and families about healthy food choices, portion control, reading nutrition labels, and meal planning.
- **Environmental Changes:** Creating communities that support physical activity through safe parks, sidewalks, and recreational facilities; limiting access to unhealthy foods in schools; and implementing policies that promote healthy choices.
- **Reducing Screen Time:** Limiting television, computer, and smartphone use, particularly among children, as screen time is associated with sedentary behavior and exposure to food marketing.
- **Family-Based Approaches:** Involving entire families in making healthier choices, as parental modeling significantly influences children's eating and activity patterns.

**Treatment Approaches:**

Clinical practice guidelines recommend comprehensive treatment programs addressing diet, physical activity, and behavior:

- **Dietary Interventions:** Creating caloric deficits through balanced, nutritious diets that individuals can sustain long-term. Approaches include portion control, increasing fruits and vegetables, reducing added sugars and saturated fats, and decreasing sodium intake.
- **Physical Activity:** The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion recommends adults engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, plus muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days per week. Building activity gradually and finding enjoyable forms of exercise increases adherence.
- **Behavioral Therapy:** Cognitive-behavioral approaches help individuals identify triggers for overeating, develop coping strategies, set realistic goals, self-monitor eating and activity, and maintain motivation.
- **Pharmacological Treatment:** For individuals with BMI ≥30 or BMI ≥27 with weight-related health conditions, medications may be prescribed in conjunction with lifestyle modifications.
- **Bariatric Surgery:** For individuals with BMI ≥40 or BMI ≥35 with serious weight-related health problems who have not achieved weight loss through other methods, surgical interventions may be considered.
- **Comprehensive Programs:** The most effective approaches combine dietary changes, increased physical activity, behavioral modification, and ongoing support, recognizing that obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term management.

## Eating Disorders

Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses characterized by severe disturbances in eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. Although eating disorders can occur across the lifespan, they most frequently appear during adolescence and early adulthood. These disorders affect both genders, although rates among women are approximately 2.5 times greater than among men.

### Anorexia Nervosa

**Definition and Diagnostic Criteria:**

According to the DSM-5, anorexia nervosa is characterized by:

- **Restriction of energy intake** leading to significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health
- **Intense fear of gaining weight** or becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight
- **Disturbance in body image:** Undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of current low body weight

**Subtypes:**
- **Restricting type:** Weight loss achieved primarily through dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise
- **Binge-eating/purging type:** Regular episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (self-induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas)

**Prevalence and Demographics:**

Anorexia nervosa is more common among non-Hispanic Whites than other ethnic groups in the United States. The typical age of onset is adolescence or early adulthood, though it can develop at any age. Females are disproportionately affected, though increasing numbers of males are being diagnosed.

### Bulimia Nervosa

**Definition and Diagnostic Criteria:**

The DSM-5 defines bulimia nervosa by:

- **Recurrent episodes of binge eating** characterized by eating an amount of food definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period and circumstances, with a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode
- **Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors** to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise
- **Self-evaluation unduly influenced** by body shape and weight
- The disturbance occurs, on average, at least once a week for three months
- The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa

### Binge-Eating Disorder

**Definition and Diagnostic Criteria:**

Binge-eating disorder involves:

- **Recurrent episodes of binge eating** with the same characteristics as bulimia nervosa
- **Marked distress** regarding binge eating
- Binge eating occurs, on average, at least once weekly for three months
- **Binge eating is not associated** with recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behavior (as in bulimia nervosa) and does not occur exclusively during anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa

### Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders

This category includes clinically significant eating disorders that do not meet full criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder but still cause significant distress or impairment.

### Risk Factors

**Genetic and Biological:**

Eating disorders run in families, suggesting genetic vulnerability. Research from King's College London found that the genetic basis of anorexia nervosa overlaps with metabolic and body measurement traits, as well as psychiatric disorders. Genetic factors also influence physical activity levels, potentially explaining the high activity levels observed in individuals with anorexia. Differences in brain activity patterns have been identified in individuals with eating disorders compared to healthy controls.

**Psychological:**

Individual psychological factors include perfectionism, low self-esteem, poor body image, difficulty expressing emotions, need for control, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Many individuals with eating disorders have co-occurring mental health conditions.

**Sociocultural:**

Cultural pressures emphasizing thinness, particularly for females, contribute to eating disorder risk. Media portrayals of unrealistic body ideals, social media exposure emphasizing appearance, and activities or occupations emphasizing weight or appearance (such as ballet, modeling, gymnastics, wrestling) increase risk.

**Developmental:**

Puberty represents a particularly vulnerable period, as adolescents experience rapid physical changes while becoming more concerned with peer acceptance and social comparison. Early-maturing girls who experience teasing about their developing bodies face increased risk for eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse.

**Interpersonal:**

Troubled family relationships, history of physical or sexual abuse, difficulty with peer relationships, and bullying or teasing about weight or appearance contribute to eating disorder development.

### Medical Complications

**Anorexia Nervosa:**

Anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, with death resulting from complications of starvation or suicide. Medical consequences include:

- Abnormally slow heart rate and low blood pressure, increasing heart failure risk
- Reduction in bone density (osteoporosis), with potential for permanent bone damage
- Muscle loss and weakness
- Severe dehydration
- Fainting, fatigue, and overall weakness
- Hair loss
- Growth of fine hair all over body (lanugo)
- Kidney failure
- Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) in females
- Infertility
- Brain damage
- Multi-organ failure

**Bulimia Nervosa:**

The binge-and-purge cycle affects the digestive system and can lead to:

- Electrolyte imbalances affecting the heart and other major organs, potentially causing heart failure
- Inflammation and possible rupture of the esophagus from frequent vomiting
- Tooth decay and staining from stomach acids
- Chronic irregular bowel movements and constipation from laxative abuse
- Gastric rupture during periods of bingeing
- Swollen salivary glands

**Binge-Eating Disorder:**

This disorder results in health risks similar to obesity:

- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol levels
- Heart disease
- Type 2 diabetes
- Gallbladder disease
- Certain types of cancer
- Sleep apnea
- Osteoarthritis

### Treatment

Effective treatment for eating disorders requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach:

**Medical Care:**

Addressing immediate health complications, restoring healthy weight (for anorexia), monitoring vital signs, and treating medical consequences of eating disorder behaviors. Hospitalization may be necessary for medically unstable patients.

**Nutritional Counseling:**

Registered dietitians work with patients to develop meal plans, normalize eating patterns, establish regular eating schedules, and develop healthier relationships with food. The goal is adequate nutrition, appropriate weight restoration or maintenance, and cessation of inappropriate compensatory behaviors.

**Psychotherapy:**

- **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Helps patients identify distorted thinking patterns about food, weight, and body image; develop healthier coping mechanisms; and change behaviors. CBT has strong evidence supporting its effectiveness, particularly for bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder.
- **Family-Based Therapy (FBT):** Particularly effective for adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Parents assume responsibility for feeding their child, gradually returning control to the adolescent as healthy eating patterns are established.
- **Interpersonal Therapy:** Focuses on relationship issues that may contribute to eating disorder behaviors.
- **Dialectical Behavior Therapy:** Helps patients develop skills in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.

**Medications:**

While no medications are FDA-approved specifically for anorexia nervosa, antidepressants (particularly SSRIs) may be prescribed for bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder, especially when co-occurring depression or anxiety is present. Medications are most effective when combined with psychotherapy.

**Support Groups:**

Peer support groups provide opportunities to share experiences, reduce isolation, and learn from others in recovery.

**Long-Term Management:**

Eating disorders are serious conditions requiring ongoing treatment and monitoring. Relapse is common, necessitating continued care even after symptoms improve. Early intervention significantly improves prognosis.

## Substance Use and Abuse

Substance use and abuse represent major public health concerns affecting individuals across the lifespan, with particularly high rates during emerging and early adulthood. Substances include alcohol, tobacco/nicotine, marijuana, prescription medications, opioids, and other illicit drugs. Substance use ranges from experimental use to abuse and addiction, with serious consequences for physical health, mental health, relationships, and overall functioning.

### Alcohol

**Prevalence:**

According to the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, among adults aged 18 and older:
- 88 percent reported drinking alcohol at some point in their lifetime
- 71 percent drank in the past year
- 57 percent drank in the past month
- 25 percent engaged in binge drinking in the past month
- 6.7 percent engaged in heavy drinking in the past month

**Binge Drinking:**

The NIAAA defines binge drinking as consuming enough alcohol to produce blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 g/dL, typically occurring after four drinks for women or five drinks for men in approximately two hours. Binge drinking poses serious health and safety risks, including car crashes, drunk-driving arrests, sexual assaults, and injuries. Long-term frequent binge drinking damages the liver and other organs.

**Alcohol and College Students:**

College students show higher rates of alcohol consumption compared to same-aged peers not in college:
- 60 percent of full-time college students aged 18-22 drank in the past month (vs. 51.5 percent of non-college peers)
- 38 percent engaged in binge drinking (vs. 33.5 percent of non-college peers)
- 12 percent engaged in heavy drinking (vs. 9.5 percent of non-college peers)

Annual consequences for college students include:
- 1,825 deaths from alcohol-related unintentional injuries (including motor vehicle crashes)
- 696,000 assaults by another student who had been drinking
- Approximately 1 in 5 meet criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder
- About 1 in 4 report academic consequences (missing class, falling behind, poor performance, lower grades)
- 97,000 experience alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape

Alcohol is strongly implicated in sexual assault on college campuses, with over 80 percent of assaults involving alcohol. Victims who were drinking are more likely to blame themselves and be blamed by others, while intoxicated perpetrators are often viewed as less responsible.

**Risk Factors for College Drinking:**

College life factors contributing to alcohol involvement include pervasive availability, inconsistent enforcement of underage drinking laws, unstructured time, stress coping, and limited adult interaction. The first six weeks of freshman year are especially vulnerable. Greek systems and athletic programs are associated with higher drinking rates, while students living with families and commuting show lowest rates.

**Long-Term Consequences:**

Chronic alcohol abuse leads to:
- Liver disease (fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis)
- Cardiovascular problems
- Cognitive impairment and brain damage
- Increased cancer risk (mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, breast, colon)
- Pancreatitis
- Weakened immune system
- Mental health problems (depression, anxiety)
- Alcohol Use Disorder (addiction)

Nearly 88,000 people die annually from alcohol-related causes, making it the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States.

### Tobacco and Nicotine

**Smoking and Vaping:**

Tobacco use, including cigarette smoking and vaping (electronic cigarettes), remains a major preventable cause of death and disease. Nicotine is highly addictive, making cessation extremely difficult even when individuals understand the health risks.

**Health Consequences:**

- Lung cancer (leading cause of cancer death)
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema and chronic bronchitis
- Heart disease and stroke
- Other cancers (mouth, throat, esophagus, pancreas, bladder, kidney, cervix)
- Respiratory infections
- Reduced fertility
- Pregnancy complications
- Premature aging of skin
- Dental problems

Secondhand smoke exposure also causes serious health problems in non-smokers, particularly children.

**Trends:**

Daily cigarette smoking is lower among college students compared to non-college same-aged peers, though vaping has increased dramatically among young adults in recent years.

### Marijuana

**Prevalence:**

Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug. Daily marijuana use reached its highest level in three decades, with 6 percent of college students smoking daily in 2014 (compared to 2 percent in 1994). For non-college same-aged individuals, daily use is approximately 12 percent.

**Effects on the Developing Brain:**

The adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to marijuana's effects. Repeated exposure during adolescence can affect cellular activity, potentially leading to:
- Impaired memory and learning
- Reduced attention and concentration
- Altered brain development
- Lower IQ in those who begin heavy use during adolescence
- Increased risk for mental health problems

**Risks:**

Marijuana use impairs judgment, reduces inhibitions, and alters mood, potentially leading to:
- Dangerous behaviors (reckless driving, risky sexual activity)
- Accidents and injuries
- Respiratory problems (when smoked)
- Cannabis Use Disorder (addiction)
- Potential gateway to other substance use

### Prescription Drug Misuse

**Prevalence:**

Emerging adults (18-25) are the largest abusers of prescription medications, including:
- Opioid pain relievers
- Anti-anxiety medications (benzodiazepines)
- ADHD medications (stimulants)

In 2016, 3.6 percent of 12-17-year-olds and twice as many 18-25-year-olds reported opioid misuse in the past 12 months.

**Consequences:**

In 2014, more than 1,700 emerging adults died from prescription drug overdoses—a fourfold increase since 1999. For every death, there were 119 additional emergency room visits that did not result in death.

### Opioids and the Overdose Epidemic

The opioid epidemic has become a major public health crisis. Opioids include:
- Prescription pain medications (oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine)
- Synthetic opioids (fentanyl)
- Heroin

Opioid misuse often begins with legitimate prescriptions for pain management but can escalate to dependence and addiction. The transition from prescription opioids to heroin has increased as individuals seek cheaper, more accessible alternatives when prescriptions are no longer available.

**Overdose Risk:**

Opioids depress respiratory function, and overdoses can be fatal. The increasing presence of fentanyl (a synthetic opioid 50-100 times more potent than morphine) in the illicit drug supply has dramatically increased overdose deaths.

### Other Substances

Other substances of abuse include:
- Cocaine and crack cocaine
- Methamphetamine
- MDMA (ecstasy/molly)
- Hallucinogens (LSD, psilocybin)
- Inhalants
- Synthetic cannabinoids ("K2/Spice")
- Synthetic cathinones ("bath salts")

### Risk Factors for Substance Abuse

**Genetic:**

Family history and genetics account for approximately 40-60 percent of addiction vulnerability. Specific genes affect how substances are metabolized and how rewarding they feel.

**Environmental:**

- Peer influence and pressure
- Easy access to substances
- Family dysfunction
- Lack of parental monitoring
- Poverty and community disorganization
- Early exposure to substances
- Trauma and adverse childhood experiences

**Psychological:**

- Mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, PTSD, ADHD)
- Poor stress management
- Low self-esteem
- Difficulty with impulse control
- Sensation-seeking personality traits

**Developmental:**

The adolescent and emerging adult brain is still developing, particularly the prefrontal cortex involved in decision-making and impulse control. This neurobiological vulnerability, combined with heightened reward sensitivity, increases risk during this developmental period.

### Prevention and Treatment

**Prevention:**

- Evidence-based school programs teaching resistance skills and social-emotional competencies
- Parental education and monitoring
- Community coalitions addressing availability and social norms
- Policy interventions (taxation, legal age restrictions, prescription monitoring programs)
- Early identification and intervention for at-risk youth

**Treatment:**

- **Detoxification:** Medically supervised withdrawal management
- **Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT):** Medications (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone for opioids; disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone for alcohol) combined with behavioral therapy
- **Behavioral Therapies:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, contingency management, family therapy
- **Residential Treatment:** Intensive programs providing structured environment
- **Outpatient Programs:** Regular therapy sessions while living at home
- **Support Groups:** 12-step programs (Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous), SMART Recovery
- **Recovery Support Services:** Housing assistance, vocational training, peer support

Substance use disorders are chronic conditions often requiring long-term treatment and multiple episodes of care. Relapse is common and should be viewed as part of the recovery process rather than treatment failure.

## Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)

Sexually transmitted infections are infections passed from person to person through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Some STIs can also be transmitted through blood exposure or from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth.

### Common STIs

**Chlamydia:**

The most commonly reported STI in the United States. Often asymptomatic, particularly in women. If untreated, can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, and ectopic pregnancy.

**Gonorrhea:**

Bacterial infection that can affect genitals, rectum, and throat. Increasing antibiotic resistance makes treatment more challenging. Untreated gonorrhea can cause PID, infertility, and disseminated infection.

**Human Papillomavirus (HPV):**

The most common STI. Most sexually active people will get HPV at some point, though the immune system usually clears the infection. Some HPV types cause genital warts; others cause cervical, anal, throat, and other cancers. Vaccines prevent the most dangerous types.

**Genital Herpes (HSV):**

Caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 or HSV-2). Characterized by painful blisters or sores. Incurable but manageable with antiviral medications. Can be transmitted even when no symptoms are present.

**Syphilis:**

Bacterial infection progressing through stages if untreated. Initial chancre (sore) is often painless and goes unnoticed. Later stages can affect multiple organ systems, including brain and heart. Treatable with antibiotics, particularly in early stages.

**HIV/AIDS:**

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) attacks the immune system, potentially leading to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress the virus to undetectable levels, preventing AIDS and transmission. Without treatment, HIV progressively destroys immune function, leaving individuals vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers.

**Trichomoniasis:**

Caused by a parasite. Often asymptomatic, particularly in men. Treatable with antibiotics.

**Hepatitis B:**

Viral infection affecting the liver. Can be transmitted sexually and through blood exposure. Vaccine available. Can become chronic, leading to liver damage, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.

### Prevalence and Risk Groups

STI prevalence is highest among adolescents and young adults (15-24 years old), who account for half of all new STI cases despite representing only 25 percent of the sexually active population. This elevated risk results from:
- Multiple or concurrent sexual partners
- Unprotected sex
- Biological vulnerability (cervical ectopy in young women)
- Barriers to STI prevention services
- Substance use impairing judgment

### Transmission Routes

STIs are transmitted through:
- **Sexual contact:** Vaginal, anal, and oral sex
- **Blood exposure:** Sharing needles, blood transfusions (rare in developed countries with screening)
- **Mother-to-child:** During pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding
- **Skin-to-skin contact:** Some STIs (HPV, herpes, syphilis) can be transmitted through contact with infected skin or mucous membranes even without penetrative sex

### Prevention

**Abstinence:**

The only method providing 100 percent protection against sexual transmission of STIs. However, abstinence-only education has not been shown to be effective in reducing STI rates.

**Condoms:**

When used consistently and correctly, condoms significantly reduce STI transmission risk. Latex and polyurethane condoms protect against HIV and reduce risk of other STIs. Effectiveness is highest when combined with other preventive strategies.

**Vaccination:**

- **HPV vaccine:** Protects against types causing most cervical cancers and genital warts. Recommended for all children at age 11-12, with catch-up vaccination through age 26.
- **Hepatitis B vaccine:** Recommended for all infants and unvaccinated adults at risk.

**Reducing Number of Partners:**

Having fewer sexual partners reduces STI exposure risk. Mutually monogamous relationships between uninfected partners eliminate sexual STI transmission.

**Communication:**

Discussing sexual health history and STI testing with partners before sexual activity.

**Regular Testing:**

Many STIs are asymptomatic, making regular screening important for sexually active individuals. Early detection enables treatment before complications develop and reduces transmission to others.

**Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):**

Daily medication reducing HIV acquisition risk by more than 90 percent when taken consistently. Recommended for individuals at high risk for HIV exposure.

**Avoiding Substances:**

Alcohol and drugs impair judgment, increasing likelihood of risky sexual behavior including unprotected sex with partners whose STI status is unknown.

### Effects on Fertility and Pregnancy

**Infertility:**

Untreated chlamydia and gonorrhea can cause PID in women, leading to scarring of fallopian tubes and infertility. In men, these infections can cause epididymitis, potentially affecting fertility.

**Pregnancy Complications:**

STIs during pregnancy can cause:
- Miscarriage
- Stillbirth
- Premature birth
- Low birth weight
- Congenital infections affecting the baby
- Transmission to the baby during delivery (HIV, herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis)

**Perinatal Transmission:**

Babies born to mothers with STIs can develop:
- Pneumonia
- Eye infections potentially causing blindness
- Brain damage
- Other serious complications

Prenatal screening and treatment can prevent most perinatal transmission.

### Testing and Treatment

**Testing:**

Various testing methods exist depending on the infection:
- Blood tests (HIV, syphilis, herpes, hepatitis)
- Urine tests (chlamydia, gonorrhea)
- Swabs of affected areas
- Physical examination

Many STIs can be detected before symptoms appear, making screening important.

**Treatment:**

- **Bacterial STIs** (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis): Treatable and curable with appropriate antibiotics. However, antibiotic resistance is increasing, particularly for gonorrhea.
- **Viral STIs** (HIV, herpes, HPV, hepatitis B): Not curable, but manageable with medications that suppress symptoms and reduce transmission risk. HIV treatment (ART) can reduce viral load to undetectable levels. Herpes antivirals reduce outbreak frequency and severity.
- **Parasitic STIs** (trichomoniasis): Curable with antibiotics.

Partner notification and treatment is crucial to prevent reinfection and stop transmission chains.

## Mental Health Disorders

Mental health disorders affect millions of people across the lifespan, impacting thinking, mood, behavior, and overall functioning. These disorders range from common conditions like depression and anxiety to less common but serious illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

### Depression

**Major Depressive Disorder:**

Characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, and additional symptoms including:
- Changes in appetite or weight
- Sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia)
- Psychomotor agitation or retardation
- Fatigue or loss of energy
- Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt
- Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
- Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide

Symptoms must be present most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks and represent a change from previous functioning.

**Prevalence:**

Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders. Prevalence increases during adolescence, particularly among females. Puberty is associated with increased depression rates, possibly due to hormonal changes, increased stress, and social pressures.

**Risk Factors:**

- **Biological:** Genetics, neurotransmitter imbalances (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine), hormonal changes, inflammation
- **Psychological:** Negative thinking patterns, poor stress management, trauma history, low self-esteem

## Conclusion

Health and risk behaviors represent critical determinants of well-being across the lifespan, with particular vulnerability during specific developmental periods. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, affecting individuals from childhood through adulthood and contributing to numerous chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. Prevention and treatment require comprehensive approaches addressing individual behaviors, family patterns, and broader environmental and policy factors that shape eating and activity patterns.

Eating disorders—including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder—most commonly emerge during adolescence and early adulthood, affecting individuals' physical health, psychological well-being, and overall functioning. These serious mental illnesses require specialized, multidisciplinary treatment addressing nutritional rehabilitation, medical complications, and underlying psychological factors. Family-based approaches show particular effectiveness for adolescents, while cognitive-behavioral therapy benefits individuals across ages.

Substance use and abuse peak during emerging and early adulthood, though patterns established earlier and continuing into later adulthood create significant health burdens. Alcohol remains the most commonly used substance, with binge drinking particularly prevalent among college students and associated with numerous negative consequences including accidents, violence, sexual assault, and academic problems. The opioid epidemic has dramatically increased overdose deaths, while marijuana use has reached historic highs. Prevention programs, policy interventions, and evidence-based treatments including medication-assisted treatment and behavioral therapies are essential for addressing substance use disorders as chronic, relapsing conditions.

Sexually transmitted infections disproportionately affect adolescents and young adults, with common STIs including chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV, herpes, syphilis, and HIV/AIDS. Many infections are asymptomatic, making regular screening important. Prevention strategies include condom use, vaccination (HPV, hepatitis B), reducing number of partners, and regular testing. Untreated STIs can cause serious complications including infertility, pregnancy complications, perinatal transmission, and increased risk for other infections.

Mental health disorders affect millions across ages, with depression and anxiety being most common. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are less common but create serious impairment. Fifty percent of mental illness begins by age 14 and 75 percent by age 24, highlighting the importance of early identification and intervention. Evidence-based treatments including psychotherapy (particularly cognitive-behavioral approaches) and medications effectively manage most mental health conditions, though stigma and access barriers often prevent individuals from receiving needed care.

Self-harm and suicide represent mental health crises requiring immediate intervention. Non-suicidal self-injury, most commonly cutting, typically begins in adolescence and serves functions including emotion regulation and communication of distress. Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults, with rates increasing in recent years. Risk factors include mental health disorders, substance abuse, relationship problems, social isolation, LGBTQ+ identity (particularly with family rejection), and access to lethal means. Prevention involves mental health treatment, gatekeeper training, reducing access to means, crisis services, and postvention support for survivors of suicide loss.

Sleep disorders including insomnia, sleep apnea, and narcolepsy significantly impact health and functioning. Many Americans experience chronic insufficient sleep due to demanding schedules, stress, electronic device use, and sleep disorders. Consequences include immune suppression, obesity, memory impairment, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mood disorders, and reduced longevity. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia and CPAP for sleep apnea are effective treatments, while public health efforts to promote sleep as essential for health are needed.

Injury and violence represent leading causes of death among children, adolescents, and young adults. Motor vehicle accidents are the primary cause of unintentional injury death in young people, with risk factors including inexperience, risk-taking, impaired and distracted driving. Child maltreatment affects millions of children, causing immediate injuries and long-term consequences through adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) affecting brain development, mental health, substance abuse, chronic disease, and overall life expectancy. Intimate partner violence affects adolescents and adults, creating physical and psychological harm. Elder abuse affects vulnerable older adults through physical, sexual, emotional, and financial abuse and neglect. Prevention requires education, support services, policy interventions, and societal commitment to ending violence.

Chronic health conditions including childhood cancer, diabetes, and asthma affect development and family functioning. Children with chronic conditions face challenges including medical treatments, activity limitations, educational disruptions, social difficulties, and uncertainty about the future. Families experience stress, financial burden, and relationship strain. Supporting children with chronic conditions and their families requires medical care, psychological support, maintaining normalcy when possible, and facilitating transitions to adult care.

Understanding health and risk topics within a developmental framework enables more effective prevention and intervention. Many health behaviors and conditions have roots in earlier developmental periods, making early intervention crucial. Adolescence and emerging adulthood represent particularly vulnerable periods due to increased independence, risk-taking, peer influence, and ongoing brain development. However, individuals across the lifespan can benefit from health promotion efforts, evidence-based treatments, and supportive environments that facilitate healthy choices and provide care when problems arise.

Addressing these health and risk topics requires coordinated efforts across multiple systems including healthcare, education, family, community, and policy levels. Individual behavior change alone is insufficient when environmental and societal factors create barriers to health. Creating supportive environments, reducing health disparities, ensuring access to prevention and treatment services, and implementing evidence-based policies are essential for promoting optimal health and well-being across the lifespan.
