# Document 13: Gender and Sexuality Development Across the Lifespan

## Introduction

Gender and sexuality represent fundamental aspects of human identity and development that profoundly shape how individuals understand themselves and navigate their social worlds throughout the lifespan. While biological sex refers to the physiological characteristics determined at conception and birth, gender encompasses the cultural, social, and psychological meanings associated with masculinity, femininity, and diverse gender expressions. Sexuality, in turn, involves the complex interplay of emotional, physical, social, and spiritual dimensions of attraction, intimacy, and sexual behavior. Understanding gender and sexuality development requires examining the intricate interactions among biological factors, cognitive processes, social learning experiences, cultural contexts, and individual agency.

From the earliest moments of life, children begin forming understandings about gender categories and their own gender identity. These understandings evolve dramatically across childhood and adolescence, becoming increasingly sophisticated and personally meaningful. Simultaneously, individuals develop their sexual identities, preferences, and behaviors within the context of their cultural environments and personal experiences. The development of gender and sexuality does not occur in isolation but intersects with other aspects of identity including race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and ability, creating unique developmental pathways for each individual.

This document provides a comprehensive examination of gender and sexuality development across the lifespan, exploring biological foundations, cognitive-developmental theories, social learning processes, cultural variations, and the experiences of diverse populations including transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals and those with various sexual orientations. By understanding these developmental processes, we can better support healthy identity formation, challenge restrictive stereotypes, promote inclusive environments, and appreciate the rich diversity of human gender and sexual expression.

## Biological Sex versus Gender

### Defining Sex

Sex refers to physiological differences found among male, female, and various intersex bodies. Sex includes both primary sex characteristics, which are those related to the reproductive system, and secondary sex characteristics, which are not directly related to the reproductive system such as breasts and facial hair. In humans, the biological sex of a child is determined at birth based on several factors, including chromosomes, gonads, hormones, internal reproductive anatomy, and genitalia.

Biological sex has traditionally been conceptualized as a binary in Western medicine, typically divided into male and female. However, anywhere from 1.0 to 1.7 percent of children are born intersex, having a variation in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, or genitals that do not allow them to be distinctly identified as male or female. Due to the existence of multiple forms of intersex conditions, which are more prevalent than researchers once thought, many view sex as existing along a spectrum rather than simply two mutually exclusive categories.

### Intersex Conditions

Some individuals who identify as transgender are intersex; that is, born with either an absence or some combination of male and female reproductive organs, sex hormones, or sex chromosomes. In humans, intersex individuals make up more than 150 million people, or about 2 percent of the world's population. There are dozens of intersex conditions, and intersex individuals demonstrate the diverse variations of biological sex.

Some examples of intersex conditions include Turner syndrome, which involves the absence of or an imperfect second X chromosome; congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a genetic disorder caused by an increased production of androgens; and androgen insensitivity syndrome, when a person has one X and one Y chromosome but is resistant to the male hormones or androgens. Greater attention to the rights of children born intersex is occurring in the medical field, and intersex children and their parents should work closely with specialists to ensure that these children develop positive gender identities.

### Gender as Social Construct

Gender denotes social and cultural characteristics that are assigned to different sexes. Sex and gender are not always synchronous, meaning they do not always line up in an easy-to-categorize way. Gender is a term that refers to social or cultural distinctions associated with being male, female, or intersex. Typically, babies born with male sex characteristics (sex) are assigned as boys (gender), and babies born with female sex characteristics (sex) are assigned as girls (gender).

Because society operates in a binary system when it comes to gender—seeing gender as only having two options—many children who are born intersex are forcibly assigned as either a boy or a girl and even surgically "corrected" to fit a particular gender. Scholars generally regard gender as a social construct, meaning that it does not exist naturally but is instead a concept that is created by cultural and societal norms.

Since the term sex refers to biological or physical distinctions, characteristics of sex will not vary significantly between different human societies. For example, persons of the female sex, in general, regardless of culture, will eventually menstruate and develop breasts that can lactate. Characteristics of gender, on the other hand, may vary greatly between different societies. For example, in American culture, it is considered feminine (or a trait of the female gender) to wear a dress or skirt. However, in many Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures, dresses or skirts—often referred to as sarongs, robes, or gowns—can be considered masculine. Similarly, the kilt worn by a Scottish male does not make him appear feminine in his culture.

## Gender Identity Development

### Definition and Early Awareness

Gender identity is a person's sense of self as a member of a particular gender. Individuals who identify with a role that corresponds to the sex assigned to them at birth—for example, they were born with male sex characteristics, were assigned as boys, and identify today as boys or men—are cisgender. Those who identify with a role that is different from their biological sex—for example, they were born with male sex characteristics, were assigned as boys, but identify today as girls, women, or some other gender altogether—are often referred to as transgender.

The term "transgender" encompasses a wide range of possible identities, including agender, genderfluid, genderqueer, two-spirit (for many Indigenous people), androgynous, and many others. Children are aware of gender roles by age two or three, and at four or five, most children are firmly entrenched in culturally appropriate gender roles. Cross-cultural studies reveal this early awareness of gender categories and expectations.

### Developmental Progression

Starting at birth, children learn the social meanings of gender from adults and their culture. Gender roles and expectations are especially portrayed in children's toys, books, commercials, video games, movies, television shows, and music. When children are between 18 months and 2 years, they begin to develop a categorical self and label themselves as a boy or girl. This marks the beginning of gender identity formation.

By age three, children demonstrate a clear preference for gender-typed toys and activities. They understand that they are either a boy or a girl and can correctly label others, though their understanding is still based largely on external characteristics like clothing and hairstyles. Between ages three and five, children achieve gender constancy, the understanding that gender remains stable over time and across situations. They come to understand that a boy who puts on a dress is still a boy, and that they themselves will remain the same gender throughout life.

During middle childhood, children develop more sophisticated understandings of gender. They recognize that gender is not determined solely by external appearance and begin to understand the biological basis of sex differences. However, this period also sees the strengthening of gender stereotypes as children work to master the expectations of their culture. Children become quite rigid in their gender-typed behavior and expectations during this time, often enforcing gender norms among their peers.

### Adolescent Gender Development

Adolescence brings significant changes in gender identity and expression. Gender role intensification occurs during early adolescence, particularly at puberty, as young people become more strongly socialized into traditional gender roles. Girls may experience pressure to appear more feminine, focusing on appearance and relationships, while boys may face expectations to demonstrate masculinity through physical dominance, emotional restraint, and heterosexual interest.

However, adolescence also provides opportunities for greater gender flexibility as cognitive development allows for more abstract thinking about gender. Teens can question gender norms and consider alternative expressions of gender. Some adolescents explore gender identities that differ from their assigned sex, while others develop more androgynous presentations that blend masculine and feminine characteristics.

Research suggests that gender identity becomes more flexible in late adolescence and early adulthood as individuals gain autonomy and exposure to diverse perspectives. Young adults often feel freer to express gender in ways that feel authentic to them, less constrained by childhood and early adolescent pressures to conform.

## Gender Roles and Socialization

### Gender Roles Defined

Gender roles refer to society's concepts of how men and women are expected to act and behave. Gender roles are based on norms, or standards, created by society. In American culture, masculine roles have traditionally been associated with strength, aggression, and dominance, while feminine roles have traditionally been associated with passivity, nurturing, and subordination. These expectations shape behavior from early childhood through adulthood.

Gender socialization is the process through which children learn these gender roles and begins at birth. Today, society is quick to outfit male infants in blue and girls in pink, even applying these color-coded gender labels while a baby is in the womb. Interestingly, these color associations with gender have not always been what they are today. Up until the beginning of the twentieth century, pink was actually more associated with boys, while blue was more associated with girls, illustrating how socially constructed these associations really are.

### Agents of Gender Socialization

Gender socialization occurs through four major agents: family, education, peer groups, and mass media. Each agent reinforces gender roles by creating and maintaining normative expectations for gender-specific behavior. Exposure also occurs through secondary agents such as religion and the workplace. Repeated exposure to these agents over time leads people into a false sense that they are acting naturally based on their gender rather than following a socially constructed role.

#### Family

Parents often supply male children with trucks, toy guns, and superhero paraphernalia, which are active toys that promote motor skills, aggression, and solitary play. Female children are often given dolls and dress-up apparel that foster nurturing, social proximity, and role play. Studies have shown that children will most likely choose to play with "gender appropriate" toys even when cross-gender toys are available because parents give children positive feedback—in the form of praise, involvement, and physical closeness—for gender-normative behavior.

The stereotypes held by parents can influence children's self-efficacy about their abilities in various domains. For example, parents who believe that girls are better at reading or that boys are better at math often find that their children's performance in these areas mirrors these stereotypes, despite the children's actual abilities. While not all children will internalize the views of others, those who do are more likely to show declines in their performance consistent with the stereotypes.

#### Education

Schools serve as powerful contexts for gender socialization. Teachers may unconsciously reinforce gender stereotypes through their interactions with students, calling on boys more frequently in math and science classes while praising girls for their neatness and compliance. Curriculum materials often portray males and females in stereotypical roles, and the structure of school activities may segregate children by gender in ways that reinforce differences.

Teachers who hold stereotypical views about gender and academic abilities can influence students' beliefs about their own capabilities. When teachers believe that certain subjects are more appropriate for one gender, students may internalize these beliefs and avoid subjects they perceive as inappropriate for their gender, limiting their educational and career opportunities.

#### Peer Groups

Children tend to segregate by gender in their peer groups, particularly during middle childhood. This gender segregation reinforces gender-typed behavior as children police each other's adherence to gender norms. Boys who engage in "feminine" activities may be teased or ostracized, while girls who are "tomboys" may face similar sanctions, though research suggests that girls have somewhat more flexibility in gender expression than boys.

Peer groups become increasingly important during adolescence, and the enforcement of gender norms can intensify during this period. Teens may pressure each other to conform to idealized versions of masculinity and femininity, including norms around appearance, behavior, and romantic and sexual relationships.

#### Mass Media

Media representations of gender exert powerful influences on gender development. Children's television shows, movies, video games, and books often present highly stereotyped portrayals of males and females. Males are more frequently depicted as active, aggressive, and dominant, while females are more often shown as passive, emotional, and focused on appearance and relationships.

Social media adds new dimensions to gender socialization in contemporary society. Young people are exposed to countless images and messages about how males and females should look and behave. These messages often promote narrow beauty standards and traditional gender roles, though social media can also provide access to more diverse and progressive representations of gender.

### Cultural Variations in Gender Socialization

The impact of culture cannot be ignored when examining gender socialization and gender roles. Different cultures have vastly different expectations for males and females, and these cultural differences shape gender development. In individualistic cultures such as the United States, independence, self-reliance, and individual achievement are valued. These cultures tend to emphasize distinct gender roles with different expectations for males and females.

In contrast, collectivistic cultures such as China or Korea place greater emphasis on group harmony, interdependence, and fulfilling one's role within the family and community. In these cultures, being obedient and compliant may be valued for both genders, though gender roles still exist and may be quite distinct. In some cultures, more than two gender categories are recognized. For example, many Indigenous cultures recognize Two-Spirit individuals who embody both masculine and feminine qualities and often hold special spiritual or social roles.

Working-class and middle-class families may socialize children differently with respect to gender. Working-class parents may emphasize traditional gender roles and expect children to be obedient and to prepare for gender-typical occupations. Middle-class parents may encourage more flexible gender expressions and support educational and career aspirations that transcend traditional gender boundaries, though gender stereotypes still influence middle-class families as well.

## Theories of Gender Development

### Biological Approaches

Biological perspectives on gender development emphasize the role of evolution, genetics, hormones, and brain structure in shaping gender-typed behavior. Evolutionary psychology suggests that gender differences in behavior evolved because they enhanced reproductive success for our ancestors. According to this view, males evolved to be more aggressive and competitive because these traits helped them compete for mates, while females evolved to be more nurturing because caring for offspring increased infant survival.

Hormones, particularly androgens like testosterone and estrogen, influence gender development beginning in prenatal development. Prenatal exposure to androgens masculinizes the brain and behavior, while the absence of high androgen levels allows for feminization. These hormonal influences continue throughout development, with puberty bringing dramatic increases in sex hormones that influence physical development and may also affect behavior and emotions.

Brain structure differences between males and females have been documented, though the implications of these differences are debated. On average, males have larger overall brain size, while females show relatively larger hippocampus and prefrontal cortex volumes. However, there is substantial overlap between males and females, and environmental experiences shape brain development throughout life. Research increasingly recognizes that brain development is bidirectional—biology influences behavior, but experiences also shape the brain.

### Social Learning Theory

Social learning theory argues that gender development results from observing, modeling, and being reinforced for gender-appropriate behavior. Children observe the behavior of male and female models in their environment—parents, siblings, peers, teachers, and media figures—and imitate the behavior of same-gender models. When children are reinforced through praise, attention, or other rewards for gender-typical behavior, they are more likely to repeat that behavior.

Punishment or negative consequences for gender-atypical behavior also shape gender development. A boy who plays with dolls may be teased by peers or discouraged by parents, making him less likely to engage in such play in the future. Observational learning occurs as children notice which behaviors are rewarded or punished for males versus females, even without directly experiencing those consequences themselves.

Cognitive social learning theory extends social learning theory by emphasizing the importance of cognitive processes. Children do not passively absorb gender lessons but actively process information about gender. They pay selective attention to gender-relevant information, remember gender-consistent information better than gender-inconsistent information, and use their understanding of gender to guide their own behavior.

### Cognitive-Developmental Theory

Kohlberg's cognitive-developmental theory proposes that children's understanding of gender develops in stages that parallel their overall cognitive development. According to this theory, children first develop gender identity around age two to three, recognizing that they are either a boy or a girl. However, young children's understanding of gender is limited. They may believe that gender can change if someone wears different clothes or engages in cross-gender activities.

Around age three to four, children achieve gender stability, understanding that gender remains the same over time. A young boy understands that he was a baby boy and will grow up to be a man. However, children at this stage may still believe that gender can change across situations. By age five to seven, most children achieve gender constancy or conservation, recognizing that gender remains stable across time and situations and is based on biological characteristics rather than superficial features.

According to Kohlberg, gender constancy is a crucial achievement because it motivates children to learn about and conform to gender norms. Once children understand that they will always be the gender they are, they become motivated to master the behaviors, preferences, and characteristics associated with their gender. They actively seek out information about gender and work to align their behavior with gender expectations.

### Gender Schema Theory

Gender schema theory, proposed by Sandra Bem and Carol Martin, integrates elements of social learning and cognitive-developmental theories. According to this theory, children develop gender schemas—organized networks of beliefs and expectations about males and females—that guide their processing of gender-relevant information. These schemas develop early in childhood and shape what children pay attention to, remember, and learn.

Children are highly motivated to understand gender categories and their own gender identity. As they develop gender schemas, they use these cognitive frameworks to organize incoming information. Children pay more attention to information about their own gender and remember gender-consistent information better than gender-inconsistent information. For example, a young girl may focus on observing and remembering what women do, while paying less attention to male activities.

Gender schemas also guide children's behavior. Children use their schemas to evaluate whether particular activities, toys, occupations, and behaviors are "for boys" or "for girls" and to guide their own choices accordingly. A boy who has learned that dolls are "for girls" will avoid playing with dolls to maintain his gender identity. These schemas can be quite rigid in young children and may lead to rejection of activities or interests that are gender-atypical.

As children develop and their cognitive abilities become more sophisticated, gender schemas can become more flexible. Adolescents and adults can develop schemas that incorporate greater variability and recognize that gender categories are social constructions rather than fixed biological categories. However, gender schemas formed in childhood can continue to influence perception and behavior throughout life.

### Developmental Intergroup Theory

Developmental intergroup theory states that many gender stereotypes are so strong because adults emphasize gender so much in culture. This theory postulates that adults' heavy focus on gender leads children to pay attention to gender as a key source of information about themselves and others, to seek out any possible gender differences, and to form rigid stereotypes based on gender that are subsequently difficult to change.

According to this theory, children are motivated to understand the social world and to determine which social categories are important in their culture. Because adults consistently label children by gender, segregate children by gender, and attribute characteristics to gender, children learn that gender is a highly salient category. This salience leads children to exaggerate gender differences, developing stereotypes that may have little basis in actual differences between males and females.

The theory suggests that reducing the salience of gender in children's environments could reduce gender stereotyping. When adults avoid unnecessarily categorizing children by gender and instead emphasize individual characteristics and abilities, children develop less rigid gender schemas. However, given the pervasiveness of gender categorization in most cultures, this remains a significant challenge.

## Transgender and Gender-Nonconforming Development

### Transgender Children

Many young children do not conform to the gender roles modeled by their culture and even push back against assigned roles. However, a small percentage of children actively reject the toys, clothing, and anatomy of their assigned sex and state they prefer the toys, clothing, and anatomy of the opposite sex or express that their gender differs from their assigned sex. Approximately 0.3 to 0.6 percent of the U.S. population identifies as transgender, identifying with a gender different from their natal sex.

Transgender adults have stated that they identified with a gender different from their assigned sex as soon as they began talking and had awareness of gender categories. Some of these children may experience gender dysphoria, defined as distress accompanying a mismatch between one's gender identity and biological sex, while other children do not experience significant discomfort regarding their gender identity despite it differing from their assigned sex.

Current research is examining young children who identify as transgender and have socially transitioned—that is, they identify with a gender different from the one assigned at birth and have changed their appearance, pronouns, and gender expression to reflect their gender identity. A longitudinal study following 300 socially transitioned transgender children between the ages of 3 and 12 found that the gender development of these socially transitioned children looked similar to the gender development of cisgender children.

These socially transitioned transgender children exhibited similar gender preferences and gender identities as their gender-matched cisgender peers. Furthermore, children who were living consistently according to their gender identity and were supported by their families exhibited positive mental health comparable to or better than cisgender children. This research challenges earlier assumptions that gender identity that differs from assigned sex represents pathology and supports the affirmative approach to transgender children.

### Gender Dysphoria

Gender dysphoria is characterized by significant distress or impairment related to the incongruence between one's experienced or expressed gender and assigned gender. Not all transgender individuals experience gender dysphoria; some individuals experience their transgender identity without significant distress. Gender dysphoria, when present, can emerge at different points across development.

In children, gender dysphoria may manifest as a strong preference for cross-gender roles in play, a strong preference for playmates of the other gender, a strong rejection of toys, games, and activities typical of one's assigned gender, and a strong desire to be of the other gender. Children may express persistent, intense distress about their assigned gender and may insist that they are a different gender.

In adolescents and adults, gender dysphoria involves a marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, lasting at least six months. This may include a strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex characteristics, a strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender, a strong desire to be of the other gender, and a strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender.

### Transition and Support

Transgender individuals may pursue various paths regarding transition, which refers to the process of aligning one's gender expression and/or body with one's gender identity. Social transition involves changes in clothing, hairstyle, name, pronouns, and gender expression. Medical transition may include hormone therapy and/or surgical interventions, though not all transgender individuals pursue medical transition.

The decision about when and how to support a transgender child's transition is complex and should involve collaboration among the child, family, and healthcare providers. The affirmative approach supports children in their gender identity and expression, allowing them to socially transition if desired and accessing puberty-blocking medication for adolescents to delay unwanted pubertal changes while the young person continues to explore their gender identity.

Research indicates that family support is crucial for transgender youth's mental health and wellbeing. Transgender youth who receive family support have significantly better mental health outcomes, including lower rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, compared to those who face family rejection. Creating supportive environments in schools and communities is also essential for promoting positive development among transgender and gender-nonconforming youth.

### Societal Challenges

Transgender and gender-nonconforming people face discrimination, oppression, and violence for not adhering to society's traditional gender norms. Transgender individuals experience high rates of harassment, assault, and discrimination in employment, housing, healthcare, and education. These experiences of minority stress—chronic stress resulting from stigma and discrimination—contribute to mental health disparities including higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among transgender individuals.

Transgender people of color face compounded discrimination based on both their gender identity and race/ethnicity. Economic marginalization is also prevalent, with many transgender individuals experiencing poverty, unemployment, and homelessness due to discrimination. Access to affirming healthcare remains a significant challenge, with many healthcare providers lacking training in transgender healthcare and some refusing to treat transgender patients.

Despite these challenges, many transgender individuals demonstrate remarkable resilience. Factors that promote resilience include family acceptance, access to affirming healthcare, connection to supportive communities including other transgender people, ability to legally change identity documents, and experiencing affirmation of one's gender identity in daily interactions. Advocacy and policy changes aimed at protecting transgender rights and expanding access to affirming services are essential for supporting this population.

## Sexual Orientation Development

### Definitions and Diversity

Sexual orientation refers to an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, both genders, or other gender identities. Sexual orientation also encompasses a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions. Sexual orientations include heterosexual (attracted to the other gender), homosexual or gay/lesbian (attracted to the same gender), bisexual (attracted to both genders), pansexual (attracted to people regardless of gender), and asexual (experiencing little or no sexual attraction).

Sexual orientation exists along a continuum rather than as discrete categories. Some individuals experience exclusive attraction to one gender, while others experience varying degrees of attraction to multiple genders. Sexual orientation is also distinct from gender identity; transgender individuals may identify with any sexual orientation, and cisgender individuals may have any sexual orientation.

Sexual fluidity, or changes in sexual attraction over time, has been documented particularly among women. Some individuals experience shifts in the gender(s) to which they are attracted across their lifespan. This fluidity does not mean that sexual orientation is a choice, but rather that sexuality can be dynamic for some individuals. Sexual orientation typically emerges in early adolescence, though some individuals recognize their sexual orientation in childhood while others do not fully recognize or acknowledge their sexual orientation until adulthood.

### Developmental Trajectory

Sexual orientation development involves several processes including attraction, self-identification, and disclosure to others. Awareness of same-sex attraction often occurs during early to middle adolescence, though some individuals report awareness of being different in childhood. Initial awareness may be accompanied by confusion, denial, or distress, particularly for youth growing up in non-accepting environments.

Self-identification as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or another non-heterosexual orientation typically follows initial awareness, though there may be a significant time lag. Young people may struggle with internalized homophobia—negative attitudes toward homosexuality that they have internalized from society—which can delay self-acceptance. Supportive environments and exposure to positive representations of sexual diversity can facilitate this process.

Coming out, or disclosing one's sexual orientation to others, is an ongoing process rather than a single event. Sexual minority individuals must repeatedly decide whether, when, how, and to whom to disclose their sexual orientation. Coming out first typically occurs with close friends, then family members, and then more broadly. Reactions to coming out vary widely and significantly impact sexual minority individuals' wellbeing.

### Biological and Environmental Influences

Research suggests that sexual orientation has biological underpinnings, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Twin studies indicate that genetics plays a role, with identical twins more likely to share sexual orientation than fraternal twins. However, the concordance is not 100 percent, indicating that environmental factors also contribute. Recent genetic studies have identified multiple genetic variants associated with same-sex sexual behavior, though no single "gay gene" has been identified.

Prenatal hormones may influence sexual orientation development. The fraternal birth order effect, in which males with older brothers are more likely to be gay, has been attributed to maternal immune responses to male fetuses that may affect sexual differentiation of the brain. Brain structure differences between heterosexual and homosexual individuals have been documented in some studies, particularly in regions related to sexual behavior and attraction, though findings are not always consistent.

No credible evidence supports the notion that parenting, childhood experiences, or early sexual experiences determine sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is not a choice and cannot be changed through therapy or other interventions. So-called "conversion therapy" or "reparative therapy" aimed at changing sexual orientation has been discredited by major mental health organizations and has been shown to be harmful, associated with increased depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.

### Sexual Orientation Across the Lifespan

Sexual orientation influences development and experiences throughout the lifespan. Sexual minority youth face unique developmental challenges including navigating stigma, managing disclosure decisions, and developing positive sexual identity in often non-affirming environments. These challenges can impact mental health, with sexual minority youth showing elevated rates of depression, anxiety, substance use, and suicidal ideation compared to heterosexual peers.

However, many sexual minority youth demonstrate resilience and positive development. Supportive families, access to LGBTQ+ communities and role models, affirming schools, and societal progress toward equality promote positive outcomes. Sexual minority youth who experience family acceptance have significantly better mental health than those who experience family rejection.

In adulthood, sexual minority individuals navigate decisions about disclosure in workplace, healthcare, and social settings. Many form committed relationships and families, including marriage for same-sex couples in jurisdictions where it is legal. Sexual minority adults of color may face compounded minority stress based on both sexual orientation and race/ethnicity. Older sexual minority adults, particularly those who came of age before the gay rights movement, may face unique challenges related to lifetime experiences of discrimination and lack of legal protections.

## Gender Stereotypes and Their Effects

### Formation and Content

Gender stereotypes are oversimplified notions about the attitudes, traits, and behavior patterns of males and females. These stereotypes develop early in childhood as children learn cultural expectations for males and females. Common stereotypes include beliefs that males are more aggressive, independent, and competent in math and science, while females are more nurturing, emotional, and competent in reading and interpersonal skills.

Gender stereotypes are prescriptive as well as descriptive—they not only describe how males and females are believed to be different but also prescribe how males and females should behave. Violation of gender stereotypes often results in social sanctions. Women who behave assertively may be judged negatively as aggressive or bossy, while men who express emotion may be viewed as weak. These prescriptive stereotypes constrain behavior and limit opportunities.

Stereotypes about gender and ability in academic domains influence educational and career trajectories. Stereotypes that math and science are male domains contribute to gender disparities in these fields, as girls may internalize beliefs that they lack ability in these areas. Similarly, stereotypes that teaching and nursing are female domains may discourage boys from pursuing these careers. These stereotypes operate at individual, interpersonal, and institutional levels to shape outcomes.

### Stereotype Threat

Stereotype threat occurs when individuals are at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their group, and awareness of these stereotypes impairs performance. Research has demonstrated stereotype threat effects for gender and academic performance. When girls are reminded of stereotypes that females perform worse than males in math before taking a math test, their performance declines compared to girls who are not reminded of these stereotypes.

Stereotype threat operates through multiple mechanisms including increased anxiety, reduced working memory capacity, and decreased motivation. The effects of stereotype threat are strongest for individuals who are highly identified with the domain and care about their performance. Interventions that reduce stereotype threat, such as presenting tests as not diagnostic of ability or providing counter-stereotypic role models, can improve performance.

### Reducing Stereotypes and Promoting Flexibility

Reducing gender stereotypes requires intervention at multiple levels. At the individual level, raising awareness of stereotypes and their effects can help people recognize and challenge their own stereotypic thinking. Teaching children that gender differences are smaller than commonly believed and emphasizing within-gender variability can reduce stereotyping.

At the interpersonal level, modeling counter-stereotypic behavior and challenging stereotypic statements when they occur can shift norms. Parents and teachers can avoid unnecessarily categorizing children by gender and instead emphasize individual interests and abilities. Providing diverse role models who demonstrate that people of all genders can succeed in all domains helps expand children's sense of possibility.

At the institutional and societal levels, policies that promote gender equity in education and employment, media representations that portray males and females in diverse roles, and legal protections against discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation all contribute to reducing stereotypes and their harmful effects. Creating inclusive environments that affirm diverse gender identities and expressions is essential for supporting all individuals.

## Sexuality Across the Lifespan

### Childhood Sexuality

While childhood is not typically thought of as a sexual period, children do exhibit curiosity about bodies and reproduction from an early age. Young children explore their own bodies, including their genitals, and may ask questions about where babies come from and anatomical differences between males and females. This curiosity is a normal part of development and provides opportunities for age-appropriate education about bodies, reproduction, and privacy.

During middle childhood, children develop greater understanding of sexuality and reproduction. They may encounter sexual content in media and through peers and develop awareness of romantic and sexual relationships. Many children experience their first romantic attractions during this period, though these are typically experienced as crushes rather than sexual desire. Providing accurate, age-appropriate information about sexuality helps children develop healthy attitudes toward sexuality.

### Adolescent Sexual Development

Puberty brings dramatic physical changes including sexual maturation and the development of sexual desire. Adolescents experience increases in sex hormones that contribute to sexual feelings and interest in romantic and sexual relationships. Sexual attraction becomes more salient, and many adolescents begin to identify their sexual orientation during this period.

Sexual behaviors during adolescence range from fantasizing and masturbation to various partnered sexual activities. The majority of adolescents in the United States have engaged in some form of sexual activity by late adolescence, with approximately 40 percent of high school students reporting sexual intercourse. Adolescent sexual behavior occurs within developmental contexts including puberty, cognitive development, peer relationships, family communication, and cultural norms.

Risks associated with adolescent sexual activity include sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy. However, many adolescents engage in sexual activity without experiencing these negative outcomes, particularly when they have access to comprehensive sexuality education and contraception. Delaying sexual initiation, having fewer partners, and using protection consistently reduce risks.

### Adult Sexuality

Adult sexuality encompasses a wide range of expressions including partnered sexual activity, masturbation, and celibacy. Sexual activity is associated with relationship satisfaction, physical health benefits, and psychological wellbeing. However, sexuality in adulthood is also influenced by relationship status, health conditions, medications, and psychosocial factors.

Sexual response includes desire, arousal, plateau, orgasm, and resolution phases, though individuals vary in their experience of these phases. Sexual desire may fluctuate across the lifespan in response to hormonal changes, health status, relationship factors, and life stress. Sexual problems including low desire, arousal difficulties, and pain during sex are common and can be addressed through medical treatment, psychotherapy, and relationship interventions.

Cultural differences in sexuality influence sexual attitudes, behaviors, and norms. Some cultures maintain conservative attitudes that restrict sexual expression to marriage, while others are more permissive regarding premarital and extramarital sexuality. Sexual double standards that judge women more harshly than men for the same sexual behavior persist in many cultures. LGBTQ+ individuals may face additional challenges navigating sexuality in non-affirming cultural contexts.

### Aging and Sexuality

Sexual activity often continues into late adulthood, though frequency typically declines with age. Many older adults remain sexually active and report satisfaction with their sexual lives. However, physical changes associated with aging can affect sexuality. Older women may experience vaginal dryness due to declining estrogen, while older men may experience erectile difficulties. Health conditions, medications, and loss of partners also impact sexuality in late adulthood.

Older LGBTQ+ adults may face unique challenges related to sexuality and aging. Lifetime experiences of discrimination and stigma, combined with heteronormative assumptions in healthcare and long-term care settings, can create barriers to affirming care. However, many older LGBTQ+ adults demonstrate resilience and maintain satisfying intimate relationships and sexual lives. Creating inclusive environments that acknowledge and affirm diverse sexualities in older adults is important for promoting wellbeing.

## Cultural and Societal Influences

### Individualistic versus Collectivistic Cultures

Cultural context profoundly shapes gender development and sexuality. Individualistic cultures such as the United States emphasize independence, personal achievement, and individual rights. In these cultures, gender roles may be somewhat flexible, and individual expression of gender and sexuality is increasingly accepted, though traditional gender expectations persist. Coming out as LGBTQ+ may be supported by cultural values of authenticity and self-expression.

Collectivistic cultures such as many Asian and Latin American cultures emphasize interdependence, family harmony, and fulfilling one's role within the family and community. Gender roles in these cultures may be more clearly defined, with strong expectations for conformity. Gender and sexual expression that deviates from cultural norms may be seen as bringing shame to the family. LGBTQ+ individuals in collectivistic cultures may face greater pressure to conceal their identities to maintain family honor.

### Race, Ethnicity, and Gender/Sexuality

Gender and sexuality intersect with race and ethnicity to create unique developmental experiences. Gender stereotypes vary across racial and ethnic groups, with different expectations for males and females within each group. For example, stereotypes of Black women as strong and independent differ from stereotypes of Asian women as submissive and passive. These racialized gender stereotypes shape experiences and opportunities.

LGBTQ+ individuals of color may experience themselves as part of a double minority, facing discrimination based on both their sexual/gender identity and their race or ethnicity. They may not feel fully accepted in predominantly White LGBTQ+ communities, where they may encounter racism, nor in their racial/ethnic communities, where they may face homophobia or transphobia. Finding affirming communities that embrace all aspects of identity is essential but can be challenging.

### Religion and Spirituality

Religion and spirituality significantly influence attitudes toward gender and sexuality. Conservative religious traditions often maintain traditional gender roles and heteronormative expectations, viewing gender as divinely ordained and sexual expression as appropriate only within heterosexual marriage. LGBTQ+ individuals from these religious backgrounds may experience profound conflict between their religious identity and sexual/gender identity.

However, many religious and spiritual traditions are affirming of gender diversity and sexual minorities. Progressive religious communities have reinterpreted traditional teachings to embrace LGBTQ+ individuals, and some traditions have long histories of accepting gender and sexual diversity. For many LGBTQ+ individuals, finding affirming religious or spiritual communities provides important support and allows integration of multiple aspects of identity.

### Changing Social Norms

Social norms regarding gender and sexuality have changed dramatically in many societies over recent decades. Legal recognition of same-sex relationships, including marriage equality in many jurisdictions, represents significant progress. Increasing visibility and acceptance of transgender individuals, including legal protections and access to transition-related healthcare, marks important advances. Greater recognition of gender as a spectrum rather than a binary is reflected in options for non-binary gender markers on official documents.

However, progress is uneven across geographic regions and social groups. Backlash against gender and sexual diversity persists, with ongoing debates about bathroom access for transgender individuals, participation in sports, and inclusion of LGBTQ+ content in education. Continued advocacy and education are necessary to promote full acceptance and equality for all individuals regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.

## Conclusion

Gender and sexuality development represents complex, multifaceted processes that unfold across the lifespan, shaped by biological predispositions, cognitive development, social learning, cultural contexts, and individual agency. From early childhood awareness of gender categories through adolescent exploration of gender identity and sexual orientation to adult expressions of gender and sexuality, these developmental processes profoundly influence how individuals understand themselves and navigate their social worlds.

Understanding gender as a social construct distinct from biological sex allows recognition of the diversity of gender identities and expressions. While biological factors including genetics, hormones, and brain structure contribute to gender development, social and cultural factors play equally important roles in shaping gender-typed behavior, preferences, and identities. Multiple theories—including social learning theory, cognitive-developmental theory, gender schema theory, and developmental intergroup theory—offer complementary perspectives on how children acquire gender knowledge and develop gender identities.

The experiences of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals illuminate the distinction between assigned sex and experienced gender identity. Research demonstrates that family and societal support for transgender youth promotes positive mental health outcomes, while rejection and discrimination contribute to significant disparities. Creating affirming environments that respect and validate diverse gender identities is essential for promoting healthy development for all children and youth.

Sexual orientation development similarly involves complex interactions among biological, psychological, and social factors. Recognition that sexual orientation exists along a continuum, emerges across development, and is not a choice has important implications for supporting sexual minority youth and adults. Coming out as LGBTQ+ involves ongoing decisions about disclosure and is influenced by family, community, and cultural contexts. Family acceptance, access to supportive communities, and societal progress toward equality promote positive outcomes for LGBTQ+ individuals.

Gender stereotypes constrain opportunities and experiences for people of all genders. These stereotypes develop early, are reinforced through multiple socialization agents, and have real consequences for academic achievement, career choices, and interpersonal relationships. Interventions that reduce stereotype threat, promote counter-stereotypic role models, and emphasize within-gender variability can help mitigate the negative effects of stereotypes.

Cultural context profoundly shapes gender and sexuality development. Different cultures maintain varying expectations for gender roles, gender expression, and sexual behavior. Individuals whose gender identities or sexual orientations differ from cultural norms may face significant challenges, particularly in non-affirming contexts. However, many individuals demonstrate remarkable resilience, and increasing global recognition of gender and sexual diversity offers hope for greater acceptance and equality.

Sexuality across the lifespan encompasses childhood curiosity about bodies, adolescent sexual development and exploration, adult sexual expression in diverse relationships, and continuation of sexuality into late adulthood. Comprehensive, age-appropriate sexuality education promotes healthy sexual development by providing accurate information, encouraging communication, and promoting respect for diversity.

The intersection of gender and sexuality with other aspects of identity including race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and ability creates unique developmental experiences. Individuals who belong to multiple marginalized groups may face compounded discrimination and stress. Recognizing and addressing these intersecting systems of oppression is essential for promoting equity and social justice.

As society continues to evolve toward greater recognition and acceptance of gender and sexual diversity, supporting healthy development for all individuals requires creating inclusive environments in families, schools, workplaces, healthcare settings, and communities. This includes challenging restrictive stereotypes, providing affirming education and resources, implementing protective policies and laws, and promoting cultural change toward acceptance of diverse gender identities and sexual orientations.

Ultimately, understanding gender and sexuality development across the lifespan reveals both universal patterns and remarkable individual diversity. By appreciating this diversity, challenging systems that constrain gender and sexual expression, and creating affirming environments for all individuals, we can promote optimal development and wellbeing throughout life. Future research and practice should continue to examine how biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors interact to shape gender and sexuality development and identify effective interventions for supporting positive outcomes for individuals across the full spectrum of gender identities and sexual orientations.
