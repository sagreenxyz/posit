# Kohlberg's Theory of Moral Development

## Overview

Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development is one of the most influential frameworks for understanding how moral reasoning evolves from childhood through adulthood. Building on Jean Piaget's earlier work on moral judgment, Kohlberg (1963, 1984) proposed that people learn moral values through active thinking and reasoning, and that moral development follows a predictable sequence of stages. His theory focuses not on whether people judge actions as right or wrong, but on the *reasoning* they use to justify their moral judgments.

---

## Theoretical Foundations

### Building on Piaget's Work

Kohlberg's theory emerged from and extended Piaget's pioneering research on moral development. Like Piaget, Kohlberg believed that:
- Moral development follows specific, predictable patterns
- Children actively construct moral understanding through reasoning
- Cognitive development provides the foundation for moral reasoning
- Moral thinking changes qualitatively as people mature

However, Kohlberg expanded Piaget's two-stage model (heteronomous and autonomous morality) into a more comprehensive six-stage framework that extends through adulthood.

### Core Principles

#### Focus on Moral Reasoning

Kohlberg's theory emphasizes *how* people think about moral issues rather than *what* they decide. The same moral decision can be justified through different levels of reasoning. For example, one person might refuse to steal because "I'll get caught and punished" (preconventional reasoning), while another refuses because "stealing violates principles of justice and respect for property rights" (postconventional reasoning).

This focus on reasoning process rather than behavioral outcome represents a crucial insight: moral development involves increasingly sophisticated ways of thinking about right and wrong, not simply learning to comply with rules.

#### Active Construction

Like Piaget, Kohlberg viewed moral development as an active constructive process. People don't passively absorb moral values from society; they actively grapple with moral dilemmas, encounter conflicts between different moral considerations, and construct increasingly complex frameworks for moral reasoning.

#### Sequential Stages

Kohlberg proposed that moral development proceeds through an invariant sequence—people progress through stages in a fixed order, never skipping stages. While the pace of development varies among individuals, and not everyone reaches the highest stages, the sequence remains constant across cultures.

#### Cognitive Prerequisites

Each stage of moral reasoning requires corresponding cognitive abilities. For instance, postconventional moral reasoning requires the abstract thinking characteristic of Piaget's formal operational stage. This means moral development is constrained by cognitive development, though cognitive maturity alone doesn't guarantee moral advancement.

---

## Research Methodology: The Moral Dilemma Approach

### The Heinz Dilemma

To study moral development, Kohlberg presented participants with hypothetical moral dilemmas and analyzed their reasoning. The most famous is the **Heinz dilemma**:

> A man's wife is dying of cancer, and there is only one drug that can save her. The only place to get the drug is at the store of a pharmacist who is known to overcharge people for drugs. The man can only pay $1,000, but the pharmacist wants $2,000 and refuses to sell it to him for less or to let him pay later. Desperate, the man later breaks into the pharmacy and steals the medicine. Should he have done that? Was it right or wrong? Why?

### Analyzing Responses

Critically, Kohlberg didn't categorize people based on whether they said Heinz should or shouldn't steal the drug. Instead, he analyzed the *reasoning* participants used to justify their position. The same answer ("Yes, he should steal it" or "No, he shouldn't") could reflect vastly different levels of moral reasoning depending on the justification provided.

For example:
- **Preconventional**: "He should steal it because he doesn't want to lose his wife who takes care of him" (Stage 2: self-interest)
- **Conventional**: "He should steal it because that's what good husbands do" (Stage 3: social approval)
- **Postconventional**: "He should steal it because life is more important than property, and preserving life is a fundamental ethical principle" (Stage 6: universal ethical principles)

### Interview Method

Kohlberg used clinical interviews in which participants:
1. Heard the moral dilemma
2. Stated whether the action was right or wrong
3. Explained their reasoning
4. Responded to follow-up questions probing their justifications
5. Considered alternative perspectives

This open-ended approach revealed the complexity and sophistication of participants' moral reasoning in ways that simple questionnaires could not.

## The Six Stages of Moral Development

Kohlberg organized moral development into three levels, each containing two stages, for a total of six stages. Each level represents a fundamentally different basis for moral reasoning.

---

## Level One: Preconventional Morality

**Preconventional morality** represents the most basic level of moral reasoning, focused on self-interest and external consequences. The term "preconventional" indicates that moral thinking has not yet internalized societal conventions or norms. Instead, morality is determined by physical consequences and personal benefits.

This level is typical of **young children (usually prior to age 9)**, though adults may revert to preconventional reasoning when under pressure or in situations where personal stakes are very high.

### Stage 1: Punishment and Obedience Orientation

At Stage 1, moral reasoning is based entirely on **avoiding punishment**. Actions are judged as wrong if they result in punishment and right if they avoid punishment. There is no consideration of others' needs, societal rules, or ethical principles—only concern about physical consequences to oneself.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Egocentric perspective**: Cannot consider others' viewpoints
- **Physical consequences determine morality**: If punished, the action was wrong; if not punished, the action was acceptable
- **Power determines right**: Authority figures who can punish define what is right
- **No concept of intent**: Actions judged solely by outcomes, not motivations

#### Examples of Stage 1 Reasoning:

**Heinz Dilemma:**
- "He should not steal the drug because he might get caught and go to jail"
- "He shouldn't break into the pharmacy because the pharmacist might find him and beat him"
- "It's wrong to steal because you'll be punished"

The focus is entirely on what will physically happen to Heinz as a consequence of his action, not on abstract concepts of right and wrong, harm to others, or societal rules.

**Everyday Examples:**
- A child doesn't hit their sibling because "Mom will put me in time-out"
- Refusing to cheat on a test because "I'll get caught and sent to the principal"
- Following rules only when authority figures are watching

#### Limitations:
- No internal moral compass—morality is entirely external
- Selfish and fearful, rather than principled
- Cannot distinguish between moral violations and breaking arbitrary rules
- Easily manipulated by those with power

---

### Stage 2: Individualism and Exchange (Instrumental Purpose)

At Stage 2, moral reasoning expands to include **self-interest and reciprocal exchange**. Actions are judged as right if they serve one's own interests or result in rewards. This stage introduces the concept of fairness, but fairness is understood in concrete, pragmatic terms: "You scratch my back; I'll scratch yours."

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Instrumental purpose**: Actions are means to satisfy personal needs
- **Concrete reciprocity**: Simple exchange and tit-for-tat fairness
- **Recognition that others have interests**: But primarily concerned with one's own
- **Market mentality**: Relationships viewed as exchanges of favors

#### Examples of Stage 2 Reasoning:

**Heinz Dilemma:**
- "He should steal the drug because he doesn't want to lose his wife, who takes care of him"
- "He should steal it because his wife will give him a big kiss and be grateful"
- "He shouldn't steal it because he might go to prison and then won't be able to enjoy his life"
- "It's okay to steal it because the pharmacist is greedy and doesn't deserve to make so much money"

The reasoning focuses on what Heinz gets out of the situation—keeping his wife who cares for him, avoiding personal loss, or satisfying his desires.

**Everyday Examples:**
- "I'll help you with your homework if you let me borrow your video game"
- "I'll be good today so I can watch TV tonight"
- "If you don't tell on me, I won't tell on you"
- "I deserve to take this because they have plenty and won't miss it"

#### Advances from Stage 1:
- Recognizes that others have their own interests and perspectives
- Understands reciprocity and exchange
- Can justify actions based on benefits, not just punishment avoidance
- More strategic and less purely fearful

#### Limitations:
- Still fundamentally self-centered
- Fairness is purely transactional, not based on principle
- No genuine concern for others' welfare (only instrumental concern)
- Cannot comprehend unconditional moral obligations

---

### Summary: Preconventional Level

At the preconventional level, morality is **external** to the individual. Children (and adults at this level) respond to moral situations based on:
- **External consequences** (punishment or reward)
- **Self-interest** (what benefits me?)
- **Physical and concrete thinking** (focused on tangible outcomes)

This level is called "preconventional" because moral reasoning has not yet internalized social conventions, rules, or standards. The person asks, "What will happen to *me*?" rather than "What will others think?" or "What principles should guide my actions?"

---

## Level Two: Conventional Morality

**Conventional morality** represents an internalization of societal norms, rules, and expectations. The term "conventional" indicates conformity to social conventions. Moral reasoning now focuses on maintaining social relationships, gaining approval, and upholding societal order.

This level is characteristic of **older children, adolescents, and most adults**. The shift from preconventional to conventional morality marks a fundamental change in perspective: from "What happens to me?" to "What will others think?" and "What does society require?"

### Stage 3: Interpersonal Concordance (Good Interpersonal Relationships)

At Stage 3, moral reasoning is based on **gaining approval and maintaining relationships**. Actions are judged as right if they please others, help others, or gain social approval. This is often called the "good boy/good girl" orientation.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Concern for others' opinions and approval**: Being seen as "good" is paramount
- **Focus on intentions**: For the first time, intentions matter as much as consequences
- **Living up to social expectations**: Wanting to be a good person in others' eyes
- **Emphasis on trust, loyalty, respect, and gratitude in relationships**
- **Stereotype-based thinking**: Good people do certain things; bad people do others

#### Examples of Stage 3 Reasoning:

**Heinz Dilemma:**
- "He should steal the drug because that is what good husbands do—they care for their wives"
- "He should steal it because people will think he's a terrible husband if he lets his wife die"
- "He shouldn't steal it because people will think he's a criminal and lose respect for him"
- "He should steal it because his wife would do the same for him, and that shows love"

The reasoning centers on how Heinz's actions affect his relationships and reputation. What will others think of him? Is he living up to the role of a good husband?

**Everyday Examples:**
- "I should help my friend because that's what good friends do"
- "I won't cheat because I don't want to disappoint my parents"
- "I'll share my lunch with her because I want her to like me"
- "He meant well, so we shouldn't be too hard on him" (considering intentions)

#### Advances from Stage 2:
- Genuine concern for others' feelings and welfare (not just instrumental)
- Recognition that intentions matter, not just outcomes
- Understanding of trust, loyalty, and caring in relationships
- Capacity for empathy and perspective-taking

#### Limitations:
- Approval-seeking can override ethical principles
- Difficulty handling situations where expectations conflict
- May conform to group norms even when those norms are problematic
- Limited to immediate relationships rather than broader societal concerns

---

### Stage 4: Social System and Conscience (Law and Order Orientation)

At Stage 4, moral reasoning expands from personal relationships to the broader social system. Actions are judged as right if they **fulfill duties, respect authority, and maintain social order**. This is often called the "law and order" orientation.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Orientation to societal laws and duties**: Rules apply to everyone, not just personal relationships
- **Importance of fulfilling responsibilities**: Doing one's duty as a citizen, employee, parent, etc.
- **Respect for legitimate authority and social institutions**
- **Concern for social order**: Society would collapse if everyone broke laws
- **Fixed rules orientation**: Laws and rules should be obeyed because they maintain order

#### Examples of Stage 4 Reasoning:

**Heinz Dilemma:**
- "He should not steal the drug because stealing is against the law, and laws must be obeyed"
- "He shouldn't steal it because if everyone broke laws when they had a good reason, society would fall apart"
- "He should try to change the law or find legal means, but he cannot break the law"
- "The pharmacist has a right to set his prices, and Heinz must respect property rights"

The reasoning emphasizes legal obligations, societal rules, and the importance of maintaining social order. Personal desires and relationships are subordinated to social duties.

**Everyday Examples:**
- "I pay my taxes because it's my civic duty, even if I don't like how they're used"
- "You can't skip school just because you don't feel like going—there are attendance rules"
- "As a citizen, I have a responsibility to vote and serve on juries"
- "Even if I disagree with my boss, I need to follow company policy"

#### Advances from Stage 3:
- Understanding of societal perspective, not just personal relationships
- Recognition that social order requires universal rule-following
- Appreciation for institutional roles and responsibilities
- Ability to differentiate between personal preferences and social obligations

#### Limitations:
- Rigid rule-following without questioning whether laws are just
- Difficulty handling conflicts between different rules or authorities
- May confuse legality with morality (if it's legal, it's right)
- Cannot critique or transcend societal norms
- "Following orders" mentality can justify harmful actions

---

### Summary: Conventional Level

At the conventional level, morality is defined by **social expectations and maintaining relationships or social order**. People at this level ask:
- "What will others think of me?" (Stage 3)
- "What does society/law require?" (Stage 4)

The key shift from preconventional to conventional reasoning is the internalization of social norms. Rather than simply avoiding punishment or seeking rewards, conventional thinkers genuinely believe in maintaining relationships, gaining approval, upholding laws, and preserving social order.

However, conventional morality still represents conformity to existing standards rather than independent critical evaluation of those standards. The question "Are these rules just?" has not yet emerged.

---

## Level Three: Postconventional Morality

**Postconventional morality** represents the highest level of moral reasoning, characterized by **self-chosen ethical principles that transcend societal conventions**. The term "postconventional" indicates moral thinking that goes *beyond* convention to evaluate whether social norms and laws are just.

This level is **rare, achieved by few adults**. It requires advanced abstract reasoning abilities and typically doesn't emerge until adulthood, if at all. Postconventional reasoning allows people to critique societal norms and envision alternative, more just arrangements.

### Stage 5: Social Contract and Individual Rights

At Stage 5, moral reasoning is based on **democratic principles, social contracts, and individual rights**. Laws are viewed as social agreements that should promote the greatest good for the greatest number, and they can be changed through democratic processes if they become unjust.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Recognition that laws are social contracts**: Created by and for people, not absolute
- **Emphasis on individual rights that transcend laws**: Life, liberty, dignity
- **Democratic values**: Laws should be created through fair processes with input from all
- **Utilitarian reasoning**: Greatest good for the greatest number
- **Laws can and should be changed when unjust**: Through proper democratic channels
- **Critical evaluation of laws**: Some laws are more just than others

#### Examples of Stage 5 Reasoning:

**Heinz Dilemma:**
- "He should steal the drug because laws can be unjust, and you have to consider the whole situation—the right to life supersedes property rights"
- "He should steal it because the pharmacist's legal right to profit shouldn't override the fundamental right to life"
- "The law against stealing exists to protect property and maintain order, but in this case, a higher principle (preserving life) takes precedence"
- "He should steal it and then work to change laws that allow pharmaceutical price gouging"

The reasoning weighs competing rights and principles, recognizing that laws exist for purposes and can be evaluated against higher standards of justice.

**Everyday Examples:**
- "I'll engage in civil disobedience against this unjust law while respecting the legal system overall"
- "This law was passed democratically, but it violates basic human rights and should be challenged"
- "The Constitution protects individual freedoms even when the majority disagrees"
- "Laws should be changed through democratic processes, but some rights are inalienable"

**Historical Examples:**
- **Civil Rights Movement**: Challenging segregation laws as unjust despite their legality
- **Women's Suffrage**: Arguing for voting rights based on principles of equality and democracy
- **Whistleblowers**: Violating organizational rules to expose injustice
- **Supreme Court Decisions**: Evaluating whether laws violate constitutional principles

#### Advances from Stage 4:
- Can critically evaluate laws and social norms
- Recognizes distinction between legality and morality
- Understands that rights and principles can supersede specific laws
- Appreciates democratic processes for creating and changing laws
- Balances individual rights with social welfare

#### Limitations:
- May not provide clear guidance when fundamental rights conflict
- Utilitarian reasoning ("greatest good") can sometimes justify violating individual rights
- Social contract theory may not address all moral issues
- Still somewhat bound to procedural justice rather than absolute principles

---

### Stage 6: Universal Ethical Principles

At Stage 6, moral reasoning is based on **self-chosen universal ethical principles** that apply to all people in all situations. These principles transcend specific laws or social contracts and represent abstract moral ideals such as justice, equality, human dignity, and the inherent worth of all persons.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Universal ethical principles**: Apply to all people, regardless of laws or social agreements
- **Self-chosen through rational reflection**: Not imposed externally, but arrived at through reasoning
- **Abstract principles**: Justice, equality, reciprocity, respect for human dignity
- **Consistency and universality**: One would want everyone to act according to these principles
- **Kant's categorical imperative**: Act only according to principles you'd want to become universal laws
- **Individual conscience**: Ultimate moral authority, even when it conflicts with laws or social norms

#### Examples of Stage 6 Reasoning:

**Heinz Dilemma:**
- "He should steal the drug because life is more important than property—the principle of preserving human life and dignity is fundamental and universal"
- "He should steal it because from the perspective of universal justice, every person has equal worth, and property rights cannot supersede the right to life"
- "If I were in Heinz's position, or the wife's position, or even the pharmacist's position, I would want a system that values life above profit"
- "The universal principle of respect for human life requires that he save his wife, and he should accept the legal consequences while maintaining his moral integrity"

The reasoning appeals to abstract, universal principles that would apply regardless of specific circumstances, laws, or social conventions.

**Philosophical Foundations:**
- **Kant's Categorical Imperative**: Act only according to maxims you could will to become universal laws
- **Rawls' Veil of Ignorance**: Choose principles of justice without knowing your position in society
- **Golden Rule**: Treat others as you would want to be treated
- **Respect for persons**: Recognize the inherent dignity and worth of all human beings

**Historical Exemplars:**
- **Mahatma Gandhi**: Nonviolent resistance based on universal principles of justice and human dignity
- **Martin Luther King Jr.**: Civil disobedience rooted in moral law transcending unjust human laws
- **Nelson Mandela**: Forgiveness and reconciliation based on principles of human dignity
- **Socrates**: Accepting death rather than violating principles of truth and justice

#### Advances from Stage 5:
- Transcends social contracts to universal principles
- Provides clearest guidance for moral action
- Can handle conflicts between rights through principled reasoning
- Individual moral autonomy and integrity
- Most consistent and coherent moral framework

#### Rarity of Stage 6:
Kohlberg acknowledged that **very few people ever reach Stage 6**. Even among adults with advanced education and high levels of moral reasoning, Stage 6 is rare. Many moral philosophy scholars and activists operate at Stage 5 rather than Stage 6.

Stage 6 requires:
- Exceptional abstract reasoning abilities
- Deep philosophical reflection on ethics
- Willingness to challenge all conventional thinking
- Courage to act on conscience even when facing severe consequences
- Integration of moral reasoning and moral action

---

### Summary: Postconventional Level

At the postconventional level, morality is defined by **self-chosen ethical principles** rather than conformity to social expectations. People at this level ask:
- "What principles of justice should govern society?" (Stage 5)
- "What universal ethical principles should guide all human action?" (Stage 6)

The key shift from conventional to postconventional reasoning is the ability to **evaluate and transcend social norms**. Rather than assuming existing laws and conventions are right, postconventional thinkers critically examine them against higher standards of justice and ethics.

This represents moral autonomy—the capacity to think independently about moral issues and act according to self-chosen principles, even when those principles conflict with social norms or personal interests.

| **Age** | **Level** | **Stage** | **Description** | **Example Response to Heinz Dilemma** |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Young children (usually prior to age 9)** | **Level 1: Preconventional Morality** | **Stage 1: Punishment and Obedience** | Focus on avoiding punishment. Actions are wrong if punished. | "He should not steal the drug because he may get caught and go to jail." |
| | | **Stage 2: Individualism and Exchange** | Focus on self-interest and rewards. "You scratch my back; I'll scratch yours." | "He should steal the drug because he doesn't want to lose his wife, who takes care of him." |

| | | **Stage 4: Law and Order** | Focus on obeying laws and maintaining social order. Duty to society. | "He should not steal because stealing is against the law, and laws must be obeyed." |
| **Rare in adolescents; few adults** | **Level 3: Postconventional Morality** | **Stage 5: Social Contract and Individual Rights** | Laws are social contracts that can be unjust. Individual rights can supersede laws. | "He should steal the drug because laws can be unjust, and you have to consider the whole situation—life is more important than property." |
| | | **Stage 6: Universal Ethical Principles** | Moral behavior based on self-chosen universal ethical principles. | "He should steal the drug because life is more important than property—this is a fundamental principle of human dignity." |

## Key Principles of Moral Development

### Invariant Sequence

Kohlberg proposed that people progress through stages in a **fixed, invariant sequence**. No one skips stages, and development always proceeds forward (though progress may stop at any stage). This universality suggests that moral development reflects fundamental features of human cognitive and social development.

Evidence for invariant sequence:
- Longitudinal studies show people progress through stages in order
- Cross-cultural studies show the same sequence across diverse societies
- People can understand reasoning at their own stage and stages below, but not stages above
- Regression to earlier stages is rare and usually temporary (e.g., under extreme stress)

### Structural Whole

Each stage represents a **structured whole**—a coherent, organized way of thinking about moral issues. People predominantly use one stage of reasoning, though they may occasionally use adjacent stages.

This means:
- Reasoning reflects an underlying cognitive structure, not just learned responses
- People are relatively consistent in the stage they use across different moral dilemmas
- Movement to a new stage involves reorganizing one's entire approach to moral reasoning

### Moral Reasoning vs. Moral Behavior

Critically, Kohlberg distinguished between **moral reasoning** and **moral behavior**. His theory describes how people *think* about moral issues, not necessarily how they *act*.

Important considerations:
- Higher-stage reasoning doesn't guarantee more moral behavior
- People often fail to act according to their moral reasoning due to weakness of will, social pressure, or personal interests
- Moral behavior requires not just reasoning ability but also moral courage and integrity
- There is frequently little correlation between stage of moral reasoning and real-life behavior

### Cognitive Prerequisites

Moral development depends on **cognitive development**. Each stage requires corresponding cognitive abilities:
- Preconventional reasoning: Concrete thinking about consequences
- Conventional reasoning: Ability to take others' perspectives and understand social systems
- Postconventional reasoning: Abstract thinking, hypothetical reasoning (formal operational thought)

However, cognitive development is necessary but not sufficient—many people with advanced cognitive abilities do not reach higher stages of moral reasoning.

### Role of Cognitive Conflict

Moral development is stimulated by **cognitive conflict** or **disequilibrium**—encountering moral dilemmas that one's current stage of reasoning cannot adequately resolve. This creates motivation to construct more sophisticated moral frameworks.

Educational implications:
- Exposure to moral dilemmas promotes development
- Encountering reasoning one stage above one's own is especially effective
- Discussion and debate help people recognize limitations of their current reasoning
- Social perspective-taking opportunities facilitate advancement

---

## Critiques and Limitations

While Kohlberg's theory has been enormously influential, research has revealed several important limitations and critiques.

### 1. Stage Model Oversimplification

**Critique**: Like Piaget's stages, Kohlberg's stage model may be **too rigid and oversimplified**.

Evidence:
- People use **different levels of reasoning for different types of problems**. Someone might use postconventional reasoning for political issues but conventional reasoning for personal relationships (Rest, 1979).
- Moral reasoning is more **variable and context-dependent** than a strict stage model suggests.
- People often use reasoning from **multiple stages** rather than predominantly one stage.
- Development is more **gradual and continuous** than discrete stages imply.

Implication: Moral reasoning may be better characterized as a developmental progression rather than distinct stages with clear boundaries.

---

### 2. Cultural Bias

**Critique**: Kohlberg's theory may be particularly appropriate for **Western, individualistic cultures** rather than universal across all cultures.

Evidence:
- In cultures emphasizing **respect for authority, social harmony, and collective welfare**, conventional reasoning (especially Stage 4) may be the most mature form of moral thought, not a limitation (Haidt, 2001).
- **Collectivistic cultures** may value allegiance to family and community over individual rights and abstract principles.
- Some cultures emphasize **religious and traditional authority** as ultimate moral guides rather than individual conscience.
- Kohlberg's scoring system may **privilege Western liberal values** (individual rights, social contracts, democratic principles).

Example: In some Asian cultures, Stage 4 reasoning that emphasizes fulfilling social roles and maintaining harmony may be considered morally sophisticated rather than a developmental limitation.

Implication: What constitutes "advanced" moral reasoning may vary across cultural contexts. Universal stages may reflect Western philosophical assumptions rather than truly universal features of moral development.

---

### 3. Gender Bias: The Justice vs. Care Debate

**Critique**: Kohlberg's theory may describe **male moral development better than female moral development**.

**Carol Gilligan's Challenge:**

Carol Gilligan (1982), a former colleague of Kohlberg, argued that his theory reflects a **justice orientation** (emphasizing rights, fairness, and individual autonomy) that is more characteristic of male moral reasoning. She proposed that females often use a **care orientation** (emphasizing relationships, responsibilities, and compassion) that Kohlberg's framework undervalues.

**Justice vs. Care:**

| **Justice Orientation** | **Care Orientation** |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Focus on rights and fairness | Focus on relationships and responsibilities |
| Emphasis on autonomy and independence | Emphasis on connection and interdependence |
| Abstract, impartial principles | Contextual, particularistic concern |
| "What is just?" | "How can I help?" |
| Hierarchical ranking (typical of Kohlberg's stages) | Network of relationships |
| Separation and individuation valued | Attachment and caring valued |

**Gilligan's Argument:**
- Because of different **socialization experiences**, males tend to emphasize justice, rights, and rules, while females emphasize caring, helping, and maintaining relationships.
- Kohlberg's framework **privileges justice reasoning** and may score care-based reasoning as less developed.
- Women who use care-based reasoning might be scored at Stage 3 (focus on relationships and pleasing others) when they are actually using sophisticated moral reasoning grounded in responsibility and compassion.

**Research Evidence:**
- There is **little evidence for gender differences in Kohlberg's stages** when using his standardized scoring system (Turiel, 1998).
- However, it is true that **girls and women tend to focus more on caring, helping, and connecting** with others than boys and men (Jaffee & Hyde, 2000).
- The difference is one of **moral orientation** (justice vs. care) rather than developmental stage.
- Both men and women can use both orientations, but there are average differences in emphasis.

**Resolution:**
Contemporary researchers recognize that both justice and care are important moral orientations. Mature moral reasoning integrates both:
- **Justice without care**: Can become cold, rigid, and inhumane
- **Care without justice**: Can become partial, inconsistent, and enable oppression

Ideally, moral development involves integrating principles of both justice (fairness, rights, impartiality) and care (compassion, responsibility, relationship).

---

### 4. Reasoning vs. Behavior Gap

**Critique**: There is frequently **little correlation between moral reasoning stage and actual moral behavior**.

Evidence:
- People often fail to act according to their stated moral principles
- Situational factors (social pressure, personal costs, stress) strongly influence behavior
- Moral action requires more than reasoning: moral courage, integrity, self-control
- People may use sophisticated reasoning to rationalize self-serving behavior

Example: A person at Stage 5 might articulate principled arguments for resisting injustice but fail to intervene when witnessing discrimination due to fear of social consequences.

Implication: Moral education must address not just reasoning but also character, virtue, emotions, and the capacity to act on moral convictions.

---

### 5. Philosophical Assumptions

**Critique**: Kohlberg's theory embeds specific **philosophical assumptions** that may not be universally accepted:
- **Rationalism**: Assumes moral judgment is primarily a rational, cognitive process (downplaying emotion and intuition)
- **Deontological ethics**: Emphasizes principles and duties (Stage 6) over consequentialist or virtue-based approaches
- **Liberal political philosophy**: Privileges individual rights and social contracts
- **Moral progress**: Assumes higher stages are objectively better, not just different

Alternative perspectives:
- **Moral intuitionism**: Moral judgments often arise from immediate intuitions rather than reasoning (Haidt)
- **Virtue ethics**: Focus on character and virtues rather than reasoning about dilemmas
- **Consequentialism**: Right actions are those producing best outcomes, not those following principles
- **Moral pluralism**: Multiple valid moral frameworks exist; no single approach is universally superior

---

### 6. Limited Population Diversity

**Critique**: Kohlberg's original research was conducted primarily with **white, male, middle-class participants**, raising questions about generalizability.

Concerns:
- Underrepresentation of females, non-Western cultures, and lower socioeconomic groups
- Moral dilemmas (like Heinz) may resonate differently across social contexts
- Scoring criteria may reflect assumptions of privileged populations

Subsequent research has addressed this by studying diverse populations, though questions about cultural appropriateness remain.

---

## Educational Applications

Despite critiques, Kohlberg's theory has significantly influenced moral education.

### Moral Discussion and Dilemma Approach

Kohlberg advocated **moral discussion** of hypothetical and real dilemmas to stimulate moral development.

**Key principles:**
- Present dilemmas that create cognitive conflict
- Encourage students to explain and justify their reasoning
- Expose students to reasoning one stage above their current level
- Foster perspective-taking and consideration of alternative viewpoints
- Create a supportive environment for open discussion

**Effectiveness:**
Research shows that structured moral discussion programs can promote advancement to higher stages, particularly when:
- Discussions continue over extended periods
- Facilitators skillfully challenge students' reasoning
- Students actively engage rather than passively listen
- Real moral issues relevant to students' lives are addressed

### Just Community Approach

Kohlberg and colleagues developed the **Just Community** approach in schools:
- Democratic decision-making about school rules and discipline
- Students and teachers collaboratively create a moral community
- Emphasis on collective responsibility and fairness
- Integration of moral education into school culture, not just curriculum

Results showed that Just Community schools promoted:
- More advanced moral reasoning
- Stronger sense of community and belonging
- Greater concern for others
- More prosocial behavior

### Limitations for Education

Educators should recognize:
- Moral development cannot be forced—it requires readiness and engagement
- Reasoning development doesn't automatically translate to behavior change
- Multiple approaches (modeling, character education, service learning) complement moral discussion
- Emotional and relational dimensions of morality matter beyond reasoning

## Relationship to Other Developmental Domains

### Cognitive Development

Moral development is **closely linked to cognitive development**:
- Preconventional reasoning requires concrete thinking about consequences
- Conventional reasoning requires perspective-taking and social understanding
- Postconventional reasoning requires abstract, hypothetical thinking (formal operations)

However, **cognitive development is necessary but not sufficient**:
- Many people with formal operational abilities don't reach postconventional reasoning
- Cognitive ability creates the *possibility* of moral advancement but doesn't guarantee it
- Social experiences, education, and reflection also matter

### Social Development

Moral reasoning develops through **social interaction**:
- Peer relationships provide opportunities for perspective-taking
- Conflicts and negotiations stimulate moral thinking
- Exposure to diverse viewpoints challenges existing reasoning
- Collaborative problem-solving fosters more sophisticated reasoning

### Emotional Development

While Kohlberg emphasized cognition, **emotions play important roles**:
- Empathy motivates care-based moral reasoning and behavior
- Moral emotions (guilt, shame, pride) reinforce moral standards
- Emotional self-regulation enables acting on moral reasoning
- Emotional intelligence complements cognitive moral reasoning

### Prosocial Behavior

**Prosocial behavior** (helping, sharing, comforting) is related to but distinct from moral reasoning:
- Higher-stage reasoning doesn't guarantee prosocial action
- Young children show prosocial behavior before sophisticated moral reasoning
- Empathy, temperament, and modeling influence prosocial behavior independent of reasoning stage
- Integration of reasoning, emotion, and behavior represents mature morality

## Contemporary Extensions

### Moral Foundations Theory

Jonathan Haidt and colleagues proposed **Moral Foundations Theory**, identifying multiple innate moral intuitions:
1. **Care/Harm**: Compassion for those who suffer
2. **Fairness/Cheating**: Justice and reciprocity
3. **Loyalty/Betrayal**: Group allegiance and cohesion
4. **Authority/Subversion**: Respect for tradition and legitimate authority
5. **Sanctity/Degradation**: Purity and avoiding contamination
6. **Liberty/Oppression**: Resentment of dominance and restriction

This pluralistic approach suggests morality is more complex than Kohlberg's justice-focused framework, with different foundations emphasized across cultures and political orientations.

### Social Domain Theory

Larry Nucci and Elliot Turiel distinguished among different social domains:
- **Moral domain**: Issues of harm, rights, fairness (universal)
- **Conventional domain**: Social norms and customs (culturally specific)
- **Personal domain**: Individual choices and preferences

This framework suggests children distinguish these domains earlier than Kohlberg proposed, showing sophisticated understanding that not all rules are moral rules.

### Neo-Kohlbergian Approaches

James Rest and colleagues developed **Neo-Kohlbergian** approaches:
- **Four Component Model**: Moral behavior requires moral sensitivity, moral judgment, moral motivation, and moral character
- **Defining Issues Test (DIT)**: Objective measure of moral reasoning that addresses some critiques of Kohlberg's interview method
- **Post-conventional schemas**: More flexible understanding of advanced moral reasoning

## Enduring Contributions

Despite critiques, Kohlberg's theory has made lasting contributions:

### 1. Focus on Reasoning Process
Revolutionary emphasis on *how* people think about morality, not just *what* they conclude. This cognitive approach opened new avenues for research and education.

### 2. Developmental Framework
Provided a comprehensive framework for understanding moral development from childhood through adulthood, showing qualitative changes in moral thinking.

### 3. Research Foundation
Generated thousands of studies examining moral development across ages, cultures, and contexts, creating a rich empirical foundation.

### 4. Educational Applications
Influenced moral education programs worldwide, demonstrating that moral reasoning can be cultivated through appropriate educational experiences.

### 5. Interdisciplinary Bridge
Connected developmental psychology, moral philosophy, education, and social psychology, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue.

### 6. Catalyst for Alternative Perspectives
Stimulated important critiques and alternative theories (Gilligan's care ethics, moral foundations theory, social domain theory), advancing the field.

### 7. Emphasis on Justice and Rights
Highlighted importance of justice, fairness, and individual rights in moral development, particularly relevant for democratic societies.

## Conclusion

Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development remains one of the most influential frameworks for understanding how moral reasoning evolves from childhood through adulthood. While contemporary research has revealed limitations—cultural bias, gender considerations, the reasoning-behavior gap, and oversimplified stage model—the core insights remain valuable.

Kohlberg demonstrated that moral development involves more than learning rules or absorbing cultural values. It requires active construction of increasingly sophisticated frameworks for thinking about right and wrong. From the self-centered calculations of preconventional morality, through the social conformity of conventional morality, to the principled autonomy of postconventional morality, individuals progress through qualitatively different ways of understanding moral obligations.

Contemporary perspectives integrate Kohlberg's justice-oriented approach with attention to care, emotion, culture, and context. Mature morality likely involves not just advanced reasoning but also emotional sensitivity, strong character, cultural wisdom, and the courage to act on one's convictions.

For educators, parents, and anyone concerned with moral development, Kohlberg's work offers crucial insights: moral growth is stimulated by encountering dilemmas, discussing reasoning, taking others' perspectives, and reflecting on principles. While moral education cannot be reduced to cognitive development alone, fostering moral reasoning remains an essential component of helping young people become thoughtful, principled, and caring members of society.

Kohlberg's theory reminds us that the journey from "What will happen to me?" to "What principles should guide human action?" represents one of the most important developmental achievements—one that continues throughout life and shapes the moral fabric of society itself.
