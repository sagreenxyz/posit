# About Posit

Posit is a modern, lightweight documentation hosting platform built with Astro.

## Why Posit?

### Performance Matters

- Static site generation for maximum speed
- Optimized builds with Astro
- Minimal JavaScript overhead

- TypeScript support
- Hot module replacement
- Clear error messages
